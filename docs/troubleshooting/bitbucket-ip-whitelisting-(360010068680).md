# Bitbucket IP whitelisting

In Bitbucket it is possible to set some IPs as trusted while blocking
all requests that come from IPs not whitelisted.

If you are using this option you will have to whitelist our IPs so
Codacy can analyze your projects. To do so, follow the instructions
on [Whitelisting IP
addresses](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/control-access-to-your-private-content-862621261.html#Controlaccesstoyourprivatecontent-ip_whitelistingWhitelistingIPaddresses) and
add the following IP addresses:

    34.254.123.99
    18.203.76.9
