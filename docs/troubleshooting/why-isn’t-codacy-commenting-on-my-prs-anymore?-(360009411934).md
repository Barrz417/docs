# Why isn't Codacy commenting on my PRs anymore?

<span class="wysiwyg-color-black wysiwyg-font-size-medium">There are
various reasons for Codacy to stop commenting on PRs. The most common
are that the user who enabled the integration no longer has permissions
on the repo or that the SSH key is no longer valid. We recommend having
a user with admin permissions on the repo recreate the integration in
Codacy.</span>
