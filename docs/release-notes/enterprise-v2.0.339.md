These updates wonâ€™t be available if you
are still using Codacy Legacy version. If you want to update Codacy to
the newest version, please contact us, and we will schedule a call to assist you
with the migration. Below is the
list of enhancements and bug fixes available with this update.

## Improvements

-   Updated
    look and feel of grade and coverage badges. Example:
    <https://github.com/codacy/node-codacy-coverage#node-codacy-coverage>
-   Introduced
    new optimization when cloning repositories reducing disk space
    usage. This may affect initial analysis performance after the update
    as the system recaches.

    for analysis afterward.

    issue allowing duplicate accounts to be created and removed existing
    duplicate accounts.

    many organizations.

    users to the organization dashboard.

    issue where the number of files covered reported in the project
    dashboard could be related to a different branch.
