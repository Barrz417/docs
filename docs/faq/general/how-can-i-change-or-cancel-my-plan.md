# How can I change or cancel my plan?

You can change or cancel [your plan](https://www.codacy.com/pricing) at any time. If you choose to cancel your annual subscription before the conclusion of the 12 months, your account will continue to work for the remainder of the annual billing period.

**If you're using Codacy Cloud** you can make changes to your plan yourself.

For single accounts:

-   To change the billing details or the plan of your account click on your avatar, select **Your Account**, and open the page **Plan and billing**

For organizations:
