# Why arenâ€™t duplication metrics being calculated?

For performance reasons, Codacy limits the analysis of code duplication
to 5000 files of the same programming language in each repository.

Besides this, if Codacy fails to calculate code duplication for a
specific programming language in a repository three times in a row (for
example, because the tool calculating the analysis runs out of memory or
times out), Codacy stops trying to analyze the metric for that language
and repository.

When this happens, Codacy does not display code duplication metrics for
the affected language:

-   The **Files** page on your repository displays a blank duplication
    value for files of the affected language.

-   The **Commits** and **Pull Request** pages display an empty **New
    Duplication** tab.

-   The analysis logs for commits will not display a duplication
    analysis task for the tool corresponding to the affected language.

As a workaround, if you are exceeding the maximum number of source code
files:

1.  We recommend that you use a [Codacy configuration
    file](/hc/en-us/articles/115002130625-Codacy-Configuration-File)
    to exclude source code files of the affected language from your
    project to decrease the number of files to be analyzed.  
      
    For example, you may be able to exclude files that are automatically
    generated from your test suite or files belonging to dependencies
    that are not maintained by your team, such as the node\_modules
    folder for JavaScript projects.  
      
2.  Reanalyze the last commit in the repository so that Codacy runs the
    code duplication analysis.

If the analysis finishes but the code duplication metric was not
calculated, follow the next steps:

-   **If you are using Codacy self-hosted**, open the **Admin panel**,
    **Repositories**, select the repository, and reset the code
    duplication analysis in **Duplication settings**. Then, reanalyze
    the last commit in the repository so that Codacy runs the code
    duplication analysis.

-   **If you are** [**analyzing your repository
    locally**](/hc/en-us/articles/360008254833-Run-local-analysis)
    with codacy-analysis-cli, consider using the flag --tool-timeout to
    specify a larger timeout for the execution of the tool.

    solve the issue, contact <support@codacy.com>.
