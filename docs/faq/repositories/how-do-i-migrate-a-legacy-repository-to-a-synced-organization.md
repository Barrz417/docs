# How do I migrate a legacy repository to a synced organization?

If you have legacy personal repositories or repositories in manual organizations, you can migrate these repositories together with their Codacy configurations to a synced organization.

!!! important
    To migrate a legacy repository you must have [admin permissions](../../organizations/manual-organizations/administrative-permissions.md) for that repository.

To migrate your legacy repository to a synced organization:

1.  Open your repository **Settings**, tab **General**.

1.  In the section **Transfer repository**, select the target organization and click the button **Transfer**.
