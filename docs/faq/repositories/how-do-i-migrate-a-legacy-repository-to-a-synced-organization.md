# How do I migrate a legacy repository to a synced organization?

If you have legacy personal repositories or repositories in manual organizations, you can migrate these repositories together with their Codacy configurations to a synced organization.

!!! important
    To migrate a legacy repository you must have [admin permissions](../../organizations/manual-organizations/administrative-permissions.md) for that repository.

To migrate your legacy repository to a synced organization:

1.  Open your repository **Settings**, tab **General**.

1.  In the section **Transfer repository**, select the target organization and click the button **Transfer**.

1.  Update the Repository Dashboard URL that you were using for the legacy repository. For example, if you had shared the Repository Dashboard with your team, provide them with the new URL.

    !!! note
        Although the old URLs for the repository dashboards continue to work, they are deprecated and we recommend that you use the new URLs instead.
