# How do I delete or move a repository to another organization?

If you wish to stop analysis and unregister your repository from Codacy, please go to your repository **Settings** -> **General**.

This will not remove your repository from your Git provider. It will only remove data concerning your repository in Codacy.

On this page, you can also transfer your repository to another of your organizations.

    To remove a repository you need to have [admin permissions](../../organizations/manual-organizations/administrative-permissions.md) for that repository.
