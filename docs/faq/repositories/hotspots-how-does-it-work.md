# Hotspots - How does it work?

On the Organization Dashboard and Repository Dashboard you have a
section called **Hotspots** where you can see a set of attention points
you can click on or dismiss, in case you don't feel they are relevant.
See below a full description of this feature and all the functionalities
behind it! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **How does it look like?**

Each hotspot, depending on the Dashboard, should apply to you on the
environment you are in: if you are on the Organization Dashboard (where
you can see all the repositories of a specific Organization) you will
see Hotspots (attention points) related with the Organization, and if
you are on the Repository Dashboard you will see Hotspots related with
the repository.

**Hotspots can be dismissed** by clicking the "x" button on the top
right-hand corner. If you dismiss an Hotspot and the situation that
generated that Hotspot is not fixed it will show up again 7 days later.

You can also click on specific content of each Hotspot - which will take
you to a specific pull request or repository, depending on the Hotspot,
so you can follow up closely what went wrong.

## **What types of Hotspots are there?**

We have started with a short-list of Hotspots and the idea is to iterate
this feature, as we see valuable for our customers. In case you have
feedback feel free to share it, we really appreciate real feedback, to
ensure that we gather the right attention points.

For now, we have implemented:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Type of Hotspot</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Description of Hotspot</span></strong></td>
<td><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Where can you find it?</span></strong></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small"><strong>Open Pull Requests Breaking standards</strong></span></td>
<td><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">On this Hotspot we let you know a specific repository has X open pull requests not up to standards.</span></td>
<td><p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">You can see this Hotspot at Organization and Repository levels.</span></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

<td><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">On this Hotspot we let you know a specific security pattern is being reported over 1 time for a specific repository.</span></td>
<td><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">You will see this Hotspot at Repository Dashboards. This way you can see if there is any specific pattern breaking too often.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">Total X reports of security patterns in a specific repository</span></strong></td>
<td><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">On this Hotspot we let you know a specific repository has more than X issues related with security.</span></td>
<td><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small">You will see this Hotspot at Organization level, to give you an overview on overall security issues your organization might be facing.</span></td>
</tr>
