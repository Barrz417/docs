# How long does it take for my repository to be analyzed?

Usually under 5 minutes, however it may take longer as this depends on the size of your repository.

If your analysis is taking a lot of time, you can [manually force a repository update](../repositories/how-do-i-manually-force-a-repository-update.md).
