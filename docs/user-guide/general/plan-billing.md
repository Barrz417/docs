# Plan and billing

## How does the 14-day trial work?

Sign up with your Git provider or Google account (no credit card required), and enjoy the full functionalities of Codacy for 14 days.

After the trial period, you can either upgrade to a paid plan to enjoy Codacy with unlimited private repositories, or do nothing and stick with the free plan for open source repositories.

## What is the best plan for me?

We offer 3 different plans:

-   Open Source
-   Pro
-   [Self-hosted](https://www.codacy.com/self-hosted)

See our [Pricing page](https://www.codacy.com/pricing) to learn more about our plans.

If you are not sure about what plan to choose, tell us about your requirements and we will get back to you with a tailored proposal.

## How many users do I need to have in my organization?

Users are developers contributing to the repository and any team member with access to the code analysis results on the Codacy UI. Your organization should have as many users as your repositories have contributors.

Learn [how to invite team members to your organization](../manual-organizations/creating-and-managing-teams.md).

## Do you offer student and non-profit plans?

If you are a student or a non-profit organization and have a team of up to 4 users you can benefit from our Startup plan for free.

Bigger teams will be eligible for a discount, so if your team has 5 users or more, please send us from your school or work email address. Please provide copies of documentation to verify your eligibility. We'll evaluate your request and get back to you.

## Can I change or cancel my plan?

Yes, you can change or cancel your plan atÂ any time. If you choose to cancel your annual subscription before the conclusion of the 12 months, your account will continue to work for the remainder of the annual billing period.

**If you're using Codacy Cloud** you can make changes to your plan yourself:

-   Manage the billing details or change the plan on the **Plan and billing** page of either your single account (click on your avatar, select **Your Account**, and open **Plan and billing**) or of your organization (click on your avatar, select **Organizations**, select your organization, and open **Plan and billing**)
-   Cancel your plan by [deleting your single account](../your-account/profile-manage.md#deleting-your-account) or [deleting your organization](../synced-organizations/what-are-synced-organizations.md#deleting-an-organization).

**If you're using Codacy Self-hosted**,  we kindly ask that you send us a message and we'll swiftly process the cancellation.

We value feedback and thank you in advance for letting us know the primary reason behind your decision to leave, whether budgetary constraints or missing deal-breaker functionality.
