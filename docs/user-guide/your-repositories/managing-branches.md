# Managing branches

Codacy supports analysis on multiple branches on your git repositories.

## Main branch

By default, Codacy will automatically trigger analysis on the **master** branch only.

You can redefine your Main branch by going to repository **Settings**, tab **Branches**.

## Pull Request

Upon **pull requests**, Codacy will automatically trigger analysis on the branch the pull request belongs to and analyze the pull request.

## Enable other branches

It is also possible to enable analysis on other branches. To do this, go to the repository **Settings**, open the **Branches** tab, and enable the branches you'd like.
