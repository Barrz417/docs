!!! tip
    Use a [dedicated service account](../../faq/troubleshooting/why-did-codacy-stop-commenting-on-pull-requests.md#service-account) to integrate Codacy with your repositories. This prevents disruption of service if the user who originally enabled the integration loses access to the repositories, which may happen when a user leaves the team or the organization.
