# Why can't I see my organization?

If you don't see your organization on Codacy, try the following steps:

1.  Make sure you have access to the organization with the account you
    are logged in
2.  GitHub Apps only: [Install Codacy in your
    organization](https://github.com/apps/codacy-production/installations/new).
3.  <span

    a refresh on Codacy by clicking the üîÅbutton found in the
    organizations' page.</span>
4.  <span
    style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Revoke
    Codacy's OAuth app on the git provider website.</span>

these steps don't solve the issue, please get in touch with us through
our in-app chat or via [email](mailto:support@codacy.com).</span>
