# Add coverage to your repo

You can configure repositories to show code coverage reports directly in Codacy.

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/blob/master/docs/index.md) to set up code coverage for your repository.

If your report format is not yet supported check some of the community's projects, e.g., [schrej/godacov](https://github.com/schrej/godacov), or contribute to our [coverage-parser](https://github.com/codacy/coverage-parser) project.

We also support partial coverage reports. See [here](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-coverage-reporter/blob/master/docs/advanced/multiple-reports.md) on how to send multiple coverage reports for the same language.
