Below we also provide guidance on resource provisioning for typical scenarios . For a custom hardware resource recommendation, please contact us at support@codacy.com . Codacy architecture # You can look at Codacy separately as two groups of components: The \"Platform\" contains the UI and other components important to treat and show results The \"Analysis\" is the swarm of workers that run between one and four linters simultaneously, depending on factors such as the number of files or the programming languages used in your projects Since all components are running on a cluster, you can increase the number of pod replicas in every deployment to give you more resilience and throughput, at a cost of increased resource usage. The following is a simplified overview of how to calculate resource allocation for the group of components \"Platform\" and \"Analysis\": Group of components vCPU Memory Platform (1 pod replica per component) 4 8 GB Analysis (1 Analysis Worker pod with up to 4 linters) 5 (per Analysis Worker) 10 GB (per Analysis Worker) Standard cluster provisioning # As described in the section above, Codacy's architecture allows scaling the \"Analysis\" group of components, meaning that the resources needed for Codacy depend mainly on the rate of commits done by your team that Codacy will be analyzing. The resources recommended on the following table are based on our experience and are also the defaults in the values-production.yaml file. You might need to adapt these defaults taking into account your use case. In particular, you should set the value of global.workerManager.workers.config.dedicatedMax to the maximum number of concurrent analysis depending on the available resources and number of replicas per component. Note For MicroK8s clusters we added an extra 1.5 vCPU and 1.5 GB memory to the \"Platform\" to account for the MicroK8s platform itself running on the same machine.

We also recommend that you create a dedicated user for Codacy, with access permissions only to the databases that are specific to Codacy: Connect to the PostgreSQL server as a database admin user. For example, using the psql command line client: psql -U postgres -h <PostgreSQL server hostname> Create the dedicated user that Codacy will use to connect to PostgreSQL. Make sure that you change the username and password to suit your security needs: CREATE USER codacy WITH PASSWORD 'codacy' ; ALTER ROLE codacy WITH CREATEDB ; Take note of the username and password you define, as you will require them later to configure the connection from Codacy to the PostgreSQL server.

Prometheus + Grafana + Loki : A comprehensive third-party monitoring solution, recommended for more advanced usage. The sections below provide instructions on how to set up each monitoring solution. Setting up monitoring using Crow # Crow displays information about the projects that are pending analysis and the jobs currently running on Codacy. Crow is installed alongside Codacy when the Helm chart is deployed to the cluster. By default, you can access Crow as follows: URL: http://<codacy hostname>/monitoring , where <codacy hostname> is the hostname of your Codacy instance Username: codacy Password: C0dacy123 We highly recommend that you define a custom password for Crow, if you haven't already done it when installing Codacy: Edit the value of global.crow.config.passwordAuth.password in the values-production.yaml file that you used to install Codacy: global : crow : config : passwordAuth : password : C0dacy123 Apply the new configuration by performing a Helm upgrade. To do so execute the command used to install Codacy : Important If you're using MicroK8s you must use the file values-microk8s.yaml together with the file values-production.yaml . To do this, uncomment the last line before running the helm upgrade command below. helm upgrade ( ...options used to install Codacy... ) \\ --version 4 .3.0 \\ --values values-production.yaml \\ # --values values-microk8s.yaml Setting up monitoring using Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki # Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. Logs can be collected using Loki , which is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system. Its data can be visualized with Grafana , a widely used open source analytics and monitoring solution. This solution is considerably more resource demanding than Crow, and is recommended only for more advanced usage. Furthermore, its installation, configuration, and management require a deeper knowledge of Kubernetes as each component must be carefully tweaked to match your specific use case, using as starting point the .yaml values files provided by us. The instructions below cover the basic installation of the components in this monitoring stack. 1. Installing Prometheus # The simplest way to set up Prometheus in your cluster is by using the Prometheus Operator bundle. Add the custom resources required for installing this bundle in your cluster: Important If you're using MicroK8s use microk8s.kubectl instead of kubectl . kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_alertmanagers.yaml\" kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_podmonitors.yaml\" kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheuses.yaml\" kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheusrules.yaml\" kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_servicemonitors.yaml\" kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_thanosrulers.yaml\" 2. Installing Loki # Obtain the configuration file for Loki, values-loki.yaml , and install it by running the command below. While the default storage class setting for Loki persistence should suit most use cases, you may need to adjust it to your specific Kubernetes installation. For instance, for MicroK8s use storageClassName: microk8s-hostpath . helm repo add loki https://grafana.github.io/loki/charts kubectl create namespace monitoring helm upgrade --install --atomic --timeout 600s loki loki/loki \\ --version 0 .28.1 --namespace monitoring --values values-loki.yaml 3. Installing Promtail # Promtail is an agent that ships the contents of local logs to a Loki instance. Obtain the configuration file for Promtail, values-promtail.yaml , and install it by running the command below. helm upgrade --install --atomic --timeout 600s promtail loki/promtail \\ --version 0 .22.2 --namespace monitoring --values values-promtail.yaml 4. Installing Prometheus and Grafana # Obtain the configuration file for the Prometheus Operator bundle , values-prometheus-operator.yaml . Then: Edit the Grafana password for the admin user and the hostname for Grafana in the values-prometheus-operator.yaml file. Install the bundle on your cluster by running the command below. helm upgrade --install --atomic --timeout 600s monitoring stable/prometheus-operator \\ --version 8 .13.8 --namespace monitoring --values values-prometheus-operator.yaml Follow the Kubernetes documentation to access the Grafana service that's now running on your cluster, using the method that best suits your use case. 5. Enable service dashboards # Warning Currently, the application metrics and information reported by the Codacy components to populate service dashboards are very limited since we're still developing these reporting capabilities. As such, we recommend that you skip this configuration. Now that you have Prometheus and Grafana installed you can enable serviceMonitor and grafana_dashboards for Codacy components. Create a file named values-monitoring.yaml with the following content: global : metrics : serviceMonitor : enabled : true grafana : enabled : true Apply this configuration by performing a Helm upgrade. To do so append --values values-monitoring.yaml to the command used to install Codacy : helm upgrade ( ...options used to install Codacy... ) \\ --version 4 .3.0 \\ --values values-monitoring.yaml","title":"Monitoring"},{"location":"chart/configuration/monitoring/#monitoring","text":"Currently, Codacy Self-hosted supports two monitoring solutions: Crow : A simple, lightweight, and built-in monitoring solution, enabled by default when you install Codacy.

This solution is considerably more resource demanding than Crow, and is recommended only for more advanced usage. Furthermore, its installation, configuration, and management require a deeper knowledge of Kubernetes as each component must be carefully tweaked to match your specific use case, using as starting point the .yaml values files provided by us.

The following diagram is a non-exhaustive overview of what you can expect to have deployed in your AWS account by using this quickstart guide. 1. Prepare your environment # Prepare your environment to set up the Amazon EKS cluster: Make sure that you have the following tools installed on your machine: Git version >= 2.0.0 AWS CLI version 1 Terraform version >= 0.12 Kubectl version >= 1.14 Set up the AWS CLI credentials for your AWS account using the AWS CLI and Terraform documentation as reference. Note that, as stated in the Terraform documentation , if your .aws/credentials are more complex you might need to set AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1 for Terraform to work correctly: export AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG = 1 Clone the Codacy chart repository and change to the directory that includes the provided Terraform configuration files: git clone https://github.com/codacy/chart.git cd chart/docs/infrastructure/EKS/ This folder includes the following infrastructure stacks: backend: Optional S3 bucket for storing the Terraform state and a DynamoDB table for state locking main: Amazon EKS cluster, including the setup of all network and node infrastructure to go from zero to a fully functional cluster You must have administration privileges on AWS to deploy (and eventually destroy) this infrastructure. The policy file aws-terraform-minimum-admin-policy.json lists the minimum privileges that are required. 2. Set up the Terraform state storage backend # The backend stores the current and historical state of your infrastructure. Although using the backend is optional, we recommend that you deploy it, particularly if you're planning to use these Terraform templates to make modifications to the cluster in the future: Initialize Terraform and deploy the infrastructure described in the backend/ directory, then follow Terraform's instructions: cd backend/ terraform init && terraform apply This creates an Amazon S3 bucket with a unique name to save the infrastructure state. Take note of the value of state_bucket_name in the output of the command. Edit the main/config.tf file and follow the instructions included in the comments to set the name of the Amazon S3 bucket created above and enable the use of the backend in those infrastructure stacks. 3. Create a vanilla Amazon EKS cluster # Create a cluster that includes all the required network and node setup: Initialize Terraform and deploy the infrastructure described in the main/ directory, then follow Terraform's instructions: cd ../main/ terraform init && terraform apply This process takes around 10 minutes. Consider if you want to tailor the cluster to your needs by customizing the cluster configuration. The cluster configuration (such as the type and number of nodes, network CIDRs, etc.) is exposed as variables in the main/variables.tf file. To customize the defaults of that file we recommend that you use a variable definitions file and set the variables in a file named terraform.tfvars in the directory main/ . The following is an example terraform.tfvars : some_key = \"a_string_value\" another_key = 3 someting_else = true Subsequently running terraform apply loads the variables in the terraform.tfvars file by default: terraform apply Set up the kubeconfig file that stores the information needed by kubectl to connect to the new cluster by default: aws eks update-kubeconfig --name codacy-cluster --alias codacy-cluster Get information about the pods in the cluster to test that the cluster was created and that kubectl can successfully connect to the cluster: kubectl get pods -A 4.

This means that you've reached the last page of results: { \"data\" : [ ... ], \"pagination\" : { \"limit\" : 10 , \"total\" : 156 } }","title":"Using pagination"},{"location":"codacy-api/examples/adding-repositories-to-codacy-programmatically/","text":"Adding repositories to Codacy programmatically # There are scenarios where manually adding Git repositories on the Codacy UI is inconvenient or time-consuming.

The next sections include detailed instructions on how to complete each step of the setup process. 1. Generating coverage reports # Before setting up Codacy to display code coverage metrics for your repository you must have tests and use tools to generate coverage reports for the languages in your repositories. There are many tools that you can use to generate coverage reports for the languages used in your repositories. The following table contains example coverage tools that generate reports in formats that Codacy supports: Language Example coverage tools Report files C# OpenCover opencover.xml (OpenCover) dotCover CLI dotcover.xml (dotCover detailedXML ) Go Golang Code Coverage Golang report files don't have a specific name. Because of this, later in the setup process you must follow specific instructions while submitting coverage to Codacy.

Uploading coverage data to Codacy # After having coverage reports set up for your repository, you must use Codacy Coverage Reporter to convert the reports to smaller JSON files and upload these files to Codacy. The recommended way to do this is using a CI/CD platform that automatically runs tests, generates coverage, and uses Codacy Coverage Reporter to upload the coverage report information for every push to your repository. Set up an API token to allow Codacy Coverage Reporter to authenticate on Codacy: If you're setting up coverage for one repository , obtain a project API token and set the following environment variable to specify your project API token: export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN = <your project API token> If you're setting up and automating coverage for multiple repositories , obtain an account API Token and set the following environment variables: CODACY_API_TOKEN: Your account API token. CODACY_ORGANIZATION_PROVIDER: Git provider hosting the repository. Must be one of gh , ghe , gl , gle , bb , or bbe to specify GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Enterprise, Bitbucket, or Bitbucket Enterprise, respectively. CODACY_USERNAME: Name of your organization on the Git provider, or your username on the Git provider if you're using a personal organization. CODACY_PROJECT_NAME: Name of the repository for which you're uploading the coverage information. export CODACY_API_TOKEN = <your account API token> export CODACY_ORGANIZATION_PROVIDER = <Git provider hosting the repository> export CODACY_USERNAME = <organization name or username on the Git provider> export CODACY_PROJECT_NAME = <repository name> Warning Never write API tokens on your configuration files and keep your API tokens well protected, as they grant owner permissions to your projects on Codacy We recommend that you set API tokens as environment variables. Check the documentation of your CI/CD platform on how to do this. If you're using Codacy Self-hosted set the following environment variable to specify your Codacy instance URL: export CODACY_API_BASE_URL = <your Codacy instance URL> Run Codacy Coverage Reporter on the root of the locally checked out branch of your Git repository , specifying the relative path to the coverage report to upload: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report -r <coverage report file name> Tip The recommended self-contained script automatically downloads and runs the most recent version of Codacy Coverage Reporter. See alternative ways of running Codacy Coverage Reporter for other ways of running Codacy Coverage Reporter, such as by installing the binary manually or using a GitHub Action or CircleCI Orb. Optionally, add a Codacy badge to the README of your repository to display the current code coverage. See the sections below for more advanced functionality, or check the troubleshooting page if you found an issue during the setup process. Uploading multiple coverage reports for the same language # If your test suite is split on different modules or runs in parallel, you must upload multiple coverage reports for the same language. To do this, specify multiple reports by repeating the flag -r . For example: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ -l Java -r report1.xml -r report2.xml -r report3.xml You can also upload all your reports dynamically using the command find . For example: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ -l Java $( find **/jacoco*.xml -printf '-r %p ' ) Note Altenatively, you can upload each report separately with the flag --partial and notify Codacy with the final command after uploading all reports. For example: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ --partial -l Java -r report1.xml bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ --partial -l Java -r report2.xml bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) final If you're sending reports for a language with the flag --partial , you should use the flag in all reports for that language to ensure the correct calculation of the coverage. Tip It might also be possible to merge the reports before uploading them to Codacy, since most coverage tools support merge/aggregation. For example, http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/merge-mojo.html . Uploading the same coverage report for multiple languages # If your test suite generates a single coverage report for more than one language, you must upload the same coverage report for each language. To do this, upload the same report multiple times, specifying each different language with the flag -l . For example: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ -l Javascript -r report.xml bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ -l TypeScript -r report.xml Submitting coverage for Golang # Codacy can't automatically detect Golang coverage report files because they don't have specific file names. If you're uploading a Golang coverage report, you must also specify the report type: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ --force-coverage-parser go -r <coverage report file name> Submitting coverage for unsupported languages # If your language is not in the list of supported languages, you can still send coverage to Codacy. To do this, provide the correct language with the flag -l , together with --force-language . For example: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ -l Kotlin --force-language -r <coverage report file name> See the list of languages that you can specify using the flag -l . Commit SHA hash detection # The Codacy Coverage Reporter automatically detects the commit SHA hash to associate with the coverage data from the following CI/CD platforms: Appveyor Azure Pipelines Bitrise Buildkite Circle CI Codefresh Codeship Docker GitLab Greenhouse CI Heroku CI Jenkins Magnum CI Semaphore CI Shippable CI Solano CI TeamCity CI Travis CI Wercker CI If the Codacy Coverage Reporter fails to detect the current commit from the CI workflow context, it will use the current commit from the local Git repository instead. However, you can also force using a specific commit SHA hash with the flag --commit-uuid . For example: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ -r report.xml \\ --commit-uuid cd4d000083a744cf1617d46af4ec108b79e06bed","title":"Adding coverage to your repository"},{"location":"coverage-reporter/#adding-coverage-to-your-repository","text":"Code coverage is a metric used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested.

Using Apps also unlocks access to new APIs, like GitHub Checks for creating better pull request reviews. To migrate to Apps all you have to do is sign out, sign in to Codacy and follow the wizard requesting the new permissions. Existing integrations will continue to work.","title":"Codacy now supports GitHub Apps February 2020"},{"location":"release-notes/cloud/cloud-2020-03-09-nodesecurity-golint-scsslint-removal/","text":"Removal of NodeSecurity, GoLint, and SCSSLint March 9, 2020 # On the week of March 9th 2020, we'll be removing some tools from Codacy.

To do this, start by removing the RabbitMQ statefulset : kubectl delete sts/codacy-rabbitmq-ha -n codacy Confirm the name of the PVCs that were created by RabbitMQ: kubectl get pvc -n codacy Finally, delete all the PVCs related to RabbitMQ.

Click on Last 3 months , Last 31 days , or Last 7 days to select the time interval of the historical data to display on the chart. Each tab displays the following information for the corresponding metric: A green or red indicator depending if the metric is within the acceptable quality level or not The current value The variation of the value introduced by the last commit Note The coverage tab only displays a value if Codacy received coverage data for the most recent commit. This is because one commit can easily change the size or number of files on the repository, or even remove some of the files that had coverage information. The chart also displays the trendline based on the past behavior and the quality standard defined on the repository quality settings . Issues breakdown # The Issues breakdown area displays the total number of issues found on the selected branch, as well as the distribution of issues across each code quality issue category.

These default code patterns result from community feedback or existing coding standards. However, you can create a coding standard adapted to your scenario by configuring the tools and code patterns that Codacy uses to analyze each repository: Open your repository Code patterns page and select the tool to configure: Enable or disable the code patterns using the checkbox for each pattern. To see an explanation of the issues that a pattern detects and how to fix them, click Show details . Some patterns also allow you to configure the rules for detecting issues: Optionally, manually reanalyze your repository to immediately take the changes into account. Otherwise, Codacy will use the new configuration when it analyzes a new commit or pull request. Tip Organization owners can change who is allowed to configure code patterns . Pattern filters # To make it easier to find relevant code patterns, you can use the sidebar to filter the patterns by language (only for tools that support multiple languages), category, or status: Tip To enable all code patterns matching a specific category, use the filter to select the relevant patterns and click Enable all . For example, to enable all Security patterns of a tool, you can use the Security filter and click Enable all . Issues detected by Codacy belong to one of the following categories: Code Style: Code formatting and syntax problems, such as variable names style and enforcing the use of brackets and quotation marks Error Prone: Code that may hide bugs and language keywords that should be used with caution, such as the operator == in JavaScript or Option.get in Scala Code Complexity: High complexity methods and classes that should be refactored Performance: Code that can have performance problems Compatibility: Mainly for frontend code, compatibility problems across different browser versions Unused Code: Unused variables and methods, code that can't be reached Security: All security problems Documentation: Methods and classes that don't have the correct comment annotations Importing pattern configurations from another repository # Importing tool and code pattern configurations from another repository can help you bootstrap and standardize the coding standard across your repositories. For example, when adding a new repository on Codacy you can copy the tool and code pattern configurations from an existing repository that's already configured, and then tweak and adapt the settings for your new repository. Tip You can also copy the tool and code pattern configurations from one repository to multiple target repositories . Important Consider the following when using this feature: Tool matching: Codacy only copies settings for tools that are available on both the source and target repositories, and overwrites the existing settings for these tools on the target repository. Toggle status: Codacy copies the enabled or disabled status of the matching tools from the source to the target repository. Configuration files: Codacy copies the UI configuration of all matching tools, even those set to use configuration files. However, the import doesn't include the configuration mode itself. The following example illustrates the points above: Source repository Target repository Target repository after import To import the tool and code pattern configurations from another repository: Open your repository Code patterns and click Import patterns . Follow the instructions to select the source repository and complete the import. Review and adjust your tool and code pattern configurations if necessary. Codacy will use the updated configurations on the next analysis. Setting a default configuration for new repositories # If you're adding multiple repositories to Codacy that should reuse the same pattern configuration for a tool, you can define that configuration as the default. Codacy automatically applies that default configuration to new repositories. To apply the same code pattern configuration to multiple repositories: Add the first repository and configure the code patterns on that repository for the relevant tools. Expand the menu at the top of the pattern list and select Set default . This option sets the current pattern configuration of all tools as the default for your account. After defining the default code pattern configuration for your account, the tools in the new repositories that you add will automatically use those configurations. Alternatively, you can also manually apply the default code pattern configuration for your account to all tools by expanding the menu at the top of the pattern list and selecting Reset . Using your own tool configuration files # Codacy supports configuration files for several tools. To use a configuration file for your static analysis tool: Push the configuration file to the root of the branch configured as the main branch on Codacy . Open your repository Code patterns page, select the tool that will use the configuration file, and select the option Configuration file : After activating the option to use the configuration file: Codacy will use the version of the configuration file in the branch being analyzed . For example, if you open a pull request that includes changes to the configuration file, the analysis results will take those changes into account. If Codacy analyzes a branch that doesn't include the configuration file, Codacy reverts to using the code patterns configured for the tool before you selected the option Configuration file on the Code patterns page.

These default code patterns result from community feedback or existing coding standards. However, you can create a coding standard adapted to your scenario by configuring the tools and code patterns that Codacy uses to analyze each repository: Open your repository Code patterns page and select the tool to configure: Enable or disable the code patterns using the checkbox for each pattern. To see an explanation of the issues that a pattern detects and how to fix them, click Show details . Some patterns also allow you to configure the rules for detecting issues: Optionally, manually reanalyze your repository to immediately take the changes into account. Otherwise, Codacy will use the new configuration when it analyzes a new commit or pull request.

Tip You can also copy the tool and code pattern configurations from one repository to multiple target repositories . Important Consider the following when using this feature: Tool matching: Codacy only copies settings for tools that are available on both the source and target repositories, and overwrites the existing settings for these tools on the target repository. Toggle status: Codacy copies the enabled or disabled status of the matching tools from the source to the target repository. Configuration files: Codacy copies the UI configuration of all matching tools, even those set to use configuration files. However, the import doesn't include the configuration mode itself. The following example illustrates the points above: Source repository Target repository Target repository after import To import the tool and code pattern configurations from another repository: Open your repository Code patterns and click Import patterns . Follow the instructions to select the source repository and complete the import. Review and adjust your tool and code pattern configurations if necessary.
