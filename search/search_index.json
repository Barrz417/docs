To install Codacy you must complete these main steps: Setting up the system requirements Ensure that your infrastructure meets the hardware and system requirements to run Codacy. Installing Codacy Install Codacy on the cluster using our Helm chart that includes all the necessary components and dependencies. Configuring Codacy Configure integrations with Git providers and set up monitoring. The next sections include detailed instructions on how to complete each step of the installation process. Make sure that you complete each step before advancing to the next one. 1. Setting up the system requirements \u00b6 Before you start, you must prepare and and provision the database server and Kubernetes or MicroK8s cluster that will host Codacy. Carefully review and set up the system requirements to run Codacy by following the instructions on the page below: System requirements Optionally, you can follow one of the guides below to quickly create a new Kubernetes or MicroK8s cluster that satisfies the characteristics described in the system requirements: Creating an Amazon EKS cluster Creating a MicroK8s cluster 2. Installing Codacy \u00b6 Install Codacy on an existing cluster using our Helm chart: Make sure that you have the following tools installed on your machine: kubectl within one minor version difference of your cluster Important If you are using MicroK8s you don't need to install kubectl because you will execute all kubectl commands as microk8s.kubectl commands instead. To simplify this, check how to create an alias for kubectl . Helm version >= 3.2 Create a cluster namespace called codacy that will group all resources related to Codacy. kubectl create namespace codacy Add the Docker registry credentials provided by Codacy together with your license to a cluster Secret. This is necessary because some Codacy Docker images are currently private. Substitute <docker_username> and <docker_password> with the Docker registry username and password and run the following command: kubectl create secret docker-registry docker-credentials \\ --docker-username = <docker_username> \\ --docker-password = <docker_password> \\ --namespace codacy Download the template file values-production.yaml and use a text editor of your choice to edit the value placeholders as described in the comments. Create an address record on your DNS provider mapping the hostname you used in the previous step to the IP address of your Ingress controller. Important If you are using MicroK8s you must map the hostname to the public IP address of the machine running MicroK8s. Add Codacy's chart repository to your Helm client and install the Codacy chart using the file values-production.yaml created previously. Important If you are using MicroK8s you must download and use the file values-microk8s.yaml together with the file values-production.yaml by uncommenting the last line in the helm upgrade command below. helm repo add codacy-stable https://charts.codacy.com/stable/ helm repo update helm upgrade --install codacy codacy-stable/codacy \\ --namespace codacy \\ --version 2 .1.1 \\ --values values-production.yaml # --values values-microk8s.yaml By now all the Codacy pods should be starting in the cluster.

Inbound HTTP TCP/80 Allow access to the Codacy website and API endpoints Inbound HTTPS TCP/443 Allow access to the Codacy website and API endpoints Outbound PostgreSQL TCP/5432 Connection to the PostgreSQL DBMS Outbound SMTP TCP/25 Connection to your SMTP server Outbound SMTPS TCP/465 Connection to your SMTP server over TLS/SSL Outbound Docker Hub * Connection to Docker Hub to download the required container images Outbound Git provider * Connection to the ports required by your remote Git provider Cluster hardware requirements \u00b6 The high-level architecture described in the next section is important in understanding how Codacy uses and allocates hardware resources. Below we also provide guidance on resource provisioning for typical scenarios . For a custom hardware resource recommendation, please contact us at support@codacy.com . Codacy architecture \u00b6 You can look at Codacy separately as two parts: The \"Platform\" contains the UI and other components important to treat and show results The \"Analysis\" is the swarm of workers that run between one and four linters simultaneously, depending on factors such as the number of files or the programming languages used in your projects Since all components are running on a cluster, you can increase the number of replicas in every deployment to give you more resilience and throughput, at a cost of increased resource usage. The following is a simplified overview of how to calculate resource allocation for the \"Platform\" and the \"Analysis\": Component vCPU Memory Platform (1 replica per component) 4 8 GB Analysis (1 Analysis Worker + up to 4 linters) 5 (per Analysis Worker) 10 GB (per Analysis Worker) Standard cluster provisioning \u00b6 The resources recommended on the following table are based on our experience and are also the defaults in the values-production.yaml file, which you might need to adapt taking into account your use case. As described in the section above, Codacy's architecture allows scaling the \"Analysis\" part of the platform, meaning that the resources needed for Codacy depend mainly on the rate of commits done by your team that Codacy will be analyzing. Important For MicroK8s clusters we added an extra 1.5 vCPU and 1.5 GB memory to the \"Platform\" to account for the MicroK8s platform itself running on the same machine.

Component Bundled in the chart? Minimum recommended NFS Yes 200 GB RabbitMQ Yes 8 GB Minio Yes 20 GB PostgreSQL No (external DB recommended) 500 GB+ PostgreSQL server setup \u00b6 Codacy requires a database server to persist data that must satisfy the following requirements: The infrastructure hosting the database server must be provisioned with the hardware requirements described below The DBMS server must be PostgreSQL version 9.6 The PostgreSQL server must be configured to accept connections from the cluster The Codacy databases and a dedicated user must be created using the instructions below Important Google, the developer of Kubernetes, doesn't recommend running database servers on your cluster . As such, consider using a managed solution like Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL, or running the PostgreSQL server on a dedicated virtual machine. We recommend that you use a managed solution to reduce maintenance and configuration costs of the PostgreSQL server. The main cloud providers all have this service that you can use, for example: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition Azure Database for PostgreSQL Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL Digital Ocean Managed Databases PostgreSQL hardware requirements \u00b6 The following are the minimum specifications recommended for provisioning the PostgreSQL server: vCPUs Memory Storage Max. concurrent connections 4 8 GB 500 GB+ 300 Preparing PostgreSQL for Codacy \u00b6 Before installing Codacy you must create a set of databases that will be used by Codacy to persist data. We also recommend that you create a dedicated user for Codacy, with access permissions only to the databases that are specific to Codacy: Connect to the PostgreSQL server as a database admin user. For example, using the psql command line client: psql -U postgres -h <PostgreSQL server hostname> Create the dedicated user that Codacy will use to connect to PostgreSQL. Make sure that you change the username and password to suit your security needs: CREATE USER codacy WITH PASSWORD 'codacy' ; ALTER ROLE codacy WITH CREATEDB ; Take note of the username and password you define, as you will require them later to configure the connection from Codacy to the PostgreSQL server. Make sure that you can connect to the PostgreSQL database using the newly created user. For example, using the psql command line client: psql -U codacy -d postgres -h <PostgreSQL server hostname> Create the databases required by Codacy: CREATE DATABASE accounts WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE analysis WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE results WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE metrics WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE filestore WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE jobs WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE activities WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE hotspots WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE listener WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE crow WITH OWNER = codacy ;","title":"System requirements"},{"location":"chart/requirements/#system-requirements","text":"Before installing Codacy you must ensure that you have the following infrastructure correctly provisioned and configured: Kubernetes or MicroK8s cluster PostgreSQL server The next sections describe in detail how to set up these prerequisites.","title":"System requirements"},{"location":"chart/requirements/#kubernetes-or-microk8s-cluster-setup","text":"The cluster running Codacy must satisfy the following requirements: The infrastructure hosting the cluster must be provisioned with the hardware and networking requirements described below The orchestration platform managing the cluster must be one of: Kubernetes version 1.14.* to 1.18.* (1.16 recommended) MicroK8s version 1.14.* to 1.18.* (1.16 recommended) The NGINX Ingress controller must be installed and correctly set up in the cluster","title":"Kubernetes or MicroK8s cluster setup"},{"location":"chart/requirements/#cluster-networking-requirements","text":"The cluster must be configured to accept and establish connections on the following ports: Service Protocol/Port Notes Inbound SSH TCP/22 MicroK8s only , to access the infrastructure remotely.

Setting up monitoring using Crow \u00b6 Crow displays information about the projects that are pending analysis and the jobs currently running on Codacy. Crow is installed alongside Codacy when the Helm chart is deployed to the cluster. By default, you can access Crow as follows: URL: http://<codacy hostname>/monitoring , where <codacy hostname> is the hostname of your Codacy instance Username: codacy Password: C0dacy123 We highly recommend that you define a custom password for Crow, if you haven't already done it when installing Codacy: Edit the value of global.crow.config.passwordAuth.password in the values-production.yaml file that you used to install Codacy: global : crow : config : passwordAuth : password : C0dacy123 Apply the new configuration by performing a Helm upgrade.

Logs can be collected using Loki , which is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system. Its data can be visualized with Grafana , a widely used open source analytics and monitoring solution. This solution is considerably more resource demanding than Crow, and is recommended only for more advanced usage. Furthermore, its installation, configuration, and management require a deeper knowledge of Kubernetes as each component must be carefully tweaked to match your specific use case, using as starting point the .yaml values files provided by us. The instructions below cover the basic installation of the components in this monitoring stack. 1. Installing Prometheus \u00b6 The simplest way to set up Prometheus in your cluster is by using the Prometheus Operator bundle. Add the custom resources required for installing this bundle in your cluster: Important If you are using MicroK8s use microk8s.kubectl instead of kubectl . kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_alertmanagers.yaml\" kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_podmonitors.yaml\" kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheuses.yaml\" kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheusrules.yaml\" kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_servicemonitors.yaml\" kubectl apply -f \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/release-0.38/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_thanosrulers.yaml\" 2. Installing Loki \u00b6 Obtain the configuration file for Loki, values-loki.yaml , and install it by running the command below. While the default storage class setting for Loki persistence should suit most use cases, you may need to adjust it to your specific Kubernetes installation. For instance, for MicroK8s use storageClassName: microk8s-hostpath . helm repo add loki https://grafana.github.io/loki/charts kubectl create namespace monitoring helm upgrade --install --atomic --timeout 600s loki loki/loki \\ --version 0 .28.1 --namespace monitoring --values values-loki.yaml 3. Installing Promtail \u00b6 Promtail is an agent that ships the contents of local logs to a Loki instance. Obtain the configuration file for Promtail, values-promtail.yaml , and install it by running the command below. helm upgrade --install --atomic --timeout 600s promtail loki/promtail \\ --version 0 .22.2 --namespace monitoring --values values-promtail.yaml 4. Installing Prometheus and Grafana \u00b6 Obtain the configuration file for the Prometheus Operator bundle , values-prometheus-operator.yaml . Then: Edit the Grafana password for the admin user and the hostname for grafana in the values-prometheus-operator.yaml file. Install the bundle on your cluster by running the command below. helm upgrade --install --atomic --timeout 600s monitoring stable/prometheus-operator \\ --version 8 .13.8 --namespace monitoring --values values-prometheus-operator.yaml Follow the Kubernetes documentation to access the Grafana service that is now running on your cluster, using the method that best suits your use case. 5. Enable service dashboards \u00b6 Warning Currently, the application metrics and information reported by the Codacy components to populate service dashboards are very limited since we are still developing these reporting capabilities. As such, we recommend that you skip this configuration. Now that you have Prometheus and Grafana installed you can enable serviceMonitor and grafana_dashboards for Codacy components. Create a file named values-monitoring.yaml with the following content: global : metrics : serviceMonitor : enabled : true grafana : enabled : true Apply this configuration by performing a Helm upgrade.

The following diagram is a non-exhaustive overview of what you can expect to have deployed in your AWS account by using this quickstart guide. 1. Prepare your environment \u00b6 Prepare your environment to set up the Amazon EKS cluster: Make sure that you have the following tools installed on your machine: Git version >= 2.0.0 AWS CLI version 1 Terraform version >= 0.12 Kubectl version >= 1.14 Set up the AWS CLI credentials for your AWS account using the AWS CLI and Terraform documentation as reference. Note that, as stated in the Terraform documentation , if your .aws/credentials are more complex you might need to set AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1 for Terraform to work correctly: export AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG = 1 Clone the Codacy chart repository and change to the directory that includes the provided Terraform configuration files: git clone https://github.com/codacy/chart.git cd chart/docs/infrastructure/EKS/ This folder includes the following infrastructure stacks: backend : Optional S3 bucket for storing the Terraform state and a DynamoDB table for state locking main : Amazon EKS cluster, including the setup of all network and node infrastructure to go from zero to a fully functional cluster You must have administration privileges on AWS to deploy (and eventually destroy) this infrastructure. The policy file aws-terraform-minimum-admin-policy.json lists the minimum privileges that are required. 2. Set up the Terraform state storage backend \u00b6 The backend stores the current and historical state of your infrastructure. Although using the backend is optional, we recommend that you deploy it, particularly if you are planning to use these Terraform templates to make modifications to the cluster in the future: Initialize Terraform and deploy the infrastructure described in the backend/ directory, then follow Terraform's instructions: cd backend/ terraform init && terraform apply This creates an Amazon S3 bucket with a unique name to save the infrastructure state. Take note of the value of state_bucket_name in the output of the command. Edit the main/config.tf file and follow the instructions included in the comments to set the name of the Amazon S3 bucket created above and enable the use of the backend in those infrastructure stacks. 3. Create a vanilla Amazon EKS cluster \u00b6 Create a cluster that includes all the required network and node setup: Initialize Terraform and deploy the infrastructure described in the main/ directory, then follow Terraform's instructions: cd ../main/ terraform init && terraform apply This process takes around 10 minutes. Consider if you want to tailor the cluster to your needs by customizing the cluster configuration. The cluster configuration (such as the type and number of nodes, network CIDRs, etc.) is exposed as variables in the main/variables.tf file. To customize the defaults of that file we recommend that you use a variable definitions file and set the variables in a file named terraform.tfvars in the directory main/ . The following is an example terraform.tfvars : some_key = \"a_string_value\" another_key = 3 someting_else = true Subsequently running terraform apply loads the variables in the terraform.tfvars file by default: terraform apply Set up the kubeconfig file that stores the information needed by kubectl to connect to the new cluster by default: aws eks update-kubeconfig --name codacy-cluster --alias codacy-cluster Get information about the pods in the cluster to test that the cluster was created and that kubectl can successfully connect to the cluster: kubectl get pods -A 4. Prepare to set up the Ingress Controller \u00b6 Prepare your infrastructure for the Ingress Controller setup, which is performed later during the installation process: Make sure that your network resources are correctly tagged, and create the following required tags if they are missing: Resource Type Key = Value VPC kubernetes.io/cluster/codacy-cluster = shared Subnet (public) kubernetes.io/cluster/codacy-cluster = shared kubernetes.io/role/elb = 1 Subnet (private) kubernetes.io/cluster/codacy-cluster = shared kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb = 1 For more information refer to the AWS documentation . Add the following chart repositories to Helm: helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com helm repo update 5. Install the NGINX Ingress Controller \u00b6 Install the NGINX Ingress Controller: Download the configuration file values-nginx.yaml for the NGINX Ingress Controller. If you wish to use a private load balancer or restrict the IP range for the provisioned load balancer edit the file and enable the required annotation and/or the corresponding setting where indicated. Install the NGINX Ingress Controller: kubectl create namespace codacy helm upgrade --install --namespace codacy --version 1 .39.0 codacy-nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress -f values-nginx.yaml Uninstalling the Amazon EKS cluster \u00b6 Warning If you proceed beyond this point you'll permanently delete and break things. Delete the Kubernetes cluster. Run the following command in the main/ directory: terraform destroy This process takes around 10 minutes. Remove the Terraform backend. If you created the Terraform backend with the provided stack you can now safely delete it. The backend is purposely created with extra settings to prevent its accidental destruction. To destroy it cleanly you must first disable these settings by editing the file backend/state_and_lock.tf and following the instructions included in the comments. Afterwards, run the following command in the backend/ directory: terraform apply && terraform destroy Note that you first have to run terraform apply to update the settings, and only then will terraform destroy be able to destroy the backend.","title":"Creating an Amazon EKS cluster"},{"location":"chart/infrastructure/eks-quickstart/#creating-an-amazon-eks-cluster","text":"Follow the instructions below to set up an Amazon EKS cluster from scratch, including all the necessary underlying infrastructure, using Terraform.

The project is publicly available on GitHub . Follow the instructions below to set up a MicroK8s instance from scratch, including all the necessary dependencies and configurations. 1. Prepare your environment \u00b6 Prepare your environment to set up the MicroK8s instance. You will need a machine running Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS that: Is correctly provisioned with the resources described for MicroK8s in the system requirements Is able to establish a connection to the PostgreSQL instance described in the system requirements Make sure that you have Helm version 3.2.1 installed. The next steps assume that you are starting from a clean install of Ubuntu Server and require that you run commands on a local or remote command line session on the machine. 2. Installing MicroK8s \u00b6 Install MicroK8s on the machine: Make sure that the package nfs-common is installed: sudo apt update && sudo apt install nfs-common -y Install MicroK8s from the 1.16/stable channel: sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel = 1 .16/stable sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER sudo su - $USER Check that MicroK8s is running: microk8s.status --wait-ready 3. Configuring MicroK8s \u00b6 Now that MicroK8s is running on the machine we can proceed to enabling the necessary addons: Configure MicroK8s to allow privileged containers: sudo mkdir -p /var/snap/microk8s/current/args sudo echo \"--allow-privileged=true\" >> /var/snap/microk8s/current/args/kube-apiserver microk8s.status --wait-ready Enable the following MicroK8s addons: microk8s.enable dns microk8s.status --wait-ready microk8s.enable storage microk8s.status --wait-ready microk8s.enable ingress microk8s.status --wait-ready Important Check the output of the commands to make sure that all the addons are enabled correctly. If by chance any of the addons fails to be enabled, re-execute the microk8s.enable command for that addon. Restart MicroK8s and its services to make sure that all configurations are working: microk8s.stop microk8s.start microk8s.status --wait-ready Export your kubeconfig so that Helm knows on which cluster to install the charts: microk8s.config > ~/.kube/config The addons are now enabled and the MicroK8s instance bootstrapped. However, we must wait for some MicroK8s pods to be ready, as failing to do so can result in the pods entering a CrashLoopBackoff state: microk8s.kubectl wait -n kube-system --for = condition = Ready pod -l k8s-app = kube-dns microk8s.kubectl wait -n kube-system --for = condition = Ready pod -l k8s-app = hostpath-provisioner # If the following command fails, you probably installed the wrong MicroK8s version microk8s.kubectl wait --all-namespaces --for = condition = Ready pod -l name = nginx-ingress-microk8s Verify that the MicroK8s configuration was successful: microk8s.status --wait-ready The output of the command should be the following: microk8s is running addons: knative: disabled jaeger: disabled fluentd: disabled gpu: disabled cilium: disabled storage: enabled registry: disabled rbac: disabled ingress: enabled dns: enabled metrics-server: disabled linkerd: disabled prometheus: disabled istio: disabled dashboard: disabled After these steps you have ensured that DNS, HTTP, and NGINX Ingress are enabled and working properly inside the MicroK8s instance. Notes on installing Codacy \u00b6 You can now follow the generic Codacy installation instructions but please note the following: You must execute all kubectl commands as microk8s.kubectl commands instead. To simplify this, we suggest that you create an alias so that you can run the commands directly as provided on the instructions: alias kubectl = microk8s.kubectl When running the helm upgrade command that installs the Codacy chart, you will be instructed to also use the file values-microk8s.yaml that downsizes some component limits, making it easier to fit Codacy in the lightweight MicroK8s solution.","title":"Creating a MicroK8s cluster"},{"location":"chart/infrastructure/microk8s-quickstart/#creating-a-microk8s-cluster","text":"MicroK8s is a lightweight, fully conformant, single-package Kubernetes developed by Canonical.

Dumping your current data out of a running Postgres \u00b6 You will need to know the following: $HOSTNAME - the hostname where the database is located. $DB_USER - the username with privileged access to the database that will perform the dump. $DB - the database that you would like to export. $DB_PASSWORD - the database password. pg_dump \u00b6 The following command lets you extract a given database into a dump file: PGPASSWORD = $DB_PASSWORD pg_dump -h $SRC_HOSTNAME -p $SRC_HOSTPORT -U $DB_USER --clean -Fc $db > /tmp/ $db .dump This will dump the file with the .dump extension into the /tmp folder. For more information and additional options, please check the official documentation. pg_restore \u00b6 To restore a database, you can run a pg_restore command to consume the dump file and replicate the data onto Postgres: PGPASSWORD = $DB_PASSWORD pg_restore -h $DEST_HOSTNAME -p $DEST_HOSTPORT -U $DB_USER -j 8 -d $db -n public --clean $db .dump With the custom format from pg_dump (by using -Fc ) we can now invoke pg_restore with multiple parallel jobs.

If you need help on getting started see how to generate coverage reports . Codacy supports the following coverage report formats: Report format Report file name Clover clover.xml Cobertura cobertura.xml dotCover XML dotcover.xml JaCoCo jacoco*.xml LCOV lcov.info, lcov.dat, *.lcov OpenCover opencover.xml PHPUnit XML (version <= 4) coverage-xml/index.xml Note If you are generating a report format that Codacy does not yet support, see submitting coverage from unsupported report formats . After having coverage reports set up for your repository, you must use Codacy Coverage Reporter to convert the reports to smaller JSON files and upload these files to Codacy. The recommended way to do this is using a CI/CD platform that automatically runs tests, generates coverage, and uses Codacy Coverage Reporter to upload the coverage report information for every commit. Set up an API token to allow Codacy Coverage Reporter to authenticate on Codacy. Obtain the project API Token from the page Integrations in your Codacy repository settings. Then, set the following environment variable to specify your project API Token: export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN = <your project API Token> Warning Never write API Tokens on your configuration files and keep your API Tokens well protected, as they grant owner permissions to your projects. We recommend that you set the API Tokens as environment variables. Check the documentation of your CI/CD platform on how to do this. If you are using Codacy Self-hosted set the following environment variable to specify your Codacy instance URL: export CODACY_API_BASE_URL = <your Codacy instance URL> Run Codacy Coverage Reporter to upload the coverage results to Codacy. The recommended way to do this is using a self-contained script that automatically downloads and runs the most recent version of Codacy Coverage Reporter: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report See alternative ways of running Codacy Coverage Reporter for other ways of running Codacy Coverage Reporter, such as when using Circle CI or GitHub actions, or to install the binary manually. Optionally, add a Codacy badge to the README of your repository to display the current code coverage. See the sections below for more advanced functionality. Uploading multiple coverage reports for the same language \u00b6 If your test suite is split in different modules or runs in parallel, you will need to upload multiple coverage reports for the same language. To do this, upload each separate report with the flags --partial , -l (to specify the language), and --coverge-reports (to specify each partial report). Then, after all reports were uploaded, notify Codacy with the final command. For example: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ -l Java -r report1.xml --partial bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ -l Java -r report2.xml --partial bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) final Important If you are sending reports for a language with the flag --partial , you should use the flag in all reports for that language to ensure the correct calculation of the coverage. Tip It might also be possible to merge the reports before uploading them to Codacy, since most coverage tools support merge/aggregation. For example, http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/merge-mojo.html . Commit SHA hash detection \u00b6 Codacy Coverage Reporter automatically detects the commit SHA hash to associate with the coverage data from several sources, in the following order: CI workflow context Codacy Coverage Reporter supports the following CI/CD platforms: Appveyor Bitrise Buildkite Circle CI Codefresh Codeship Docker GitLab Greenhouse CI Heroku CI Jenkins Magnum CI Semaphore CI Shippable CI Solano CI TeamCity CI Travis CI Wercker CI Git repository directory If Codacy Coverage Reporter finds a Git repository directory it will use the current commit.

Submitting coverage for unsupported languages \u00b6 If your language is not in the list of supported languages, you can still send coverage to Codacy. You can do it by providing the correct language name with the flag -l , together with --force-language . For example: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report -l Kotlin --force-language See the list of languages that you can specify using the flag -l . Submitting coverage from unsupported report formats \u00b6 If you are generating a report format that Codacy does not yet support, try using community projects such as t-yuki/gocover-cobertura and danielpalme/ReportGenerator , or alternatively contribute to our codacy/coverage-parser project. As a workaround, you can also send the coverage data directly by calling the Codacy API endpoint saveCoverage . The following is an example of the JSON payload: { \"total\" : 23 , \"fileReports\" : [ { \"filename\" : \"src/Codacy/Coverage/Parser/CloverParser.php\" , \"total\" : 54 , \"coverage\" : { \"3\" : 3 , \"5\" : 0 , \"7\" : 1 } } ] } Note that all \"coverable\" lines should be present on the coverage node of the JSON payload. In the example you can see \"5\": 0 , meaning that line 5 is not covered. Can't guess any report due to no matching \u00b6 Codacy Coverage Reporter automatically searches for coverage reports matching the file name conventions for supported formats . However, if Codacy Coverage Reporter does not find your coverage report, you can explicitly define the report file name with the flag -r . For example: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report \\ -r <my report> JsonParseException while uploading C# coverage data \u00b6 If you are using dotCover to generate coverage reports for your C# projects, you should exclude xUnit files from the coverage analysis as follows: dotCover.exe cover ... /Filters = -:xunit* By default, dotCover includes xUnit files in the coverage analysis and this results in larger coverage reports.

For example: Repositories added Expected delay 1 to 10 Small 11 to 100 Considerable More than 100 Extreme To avoid these delays, we recommend that you add repositories in small batches or that you space out adding new repositories in time.

This tutorial covers only the template code to write the engine; if you didn't check the full tutorial, please refer to the Tool Developer Guide . Scala Engine Template \u00b6 We use Scala to integrate our tools at Codacy. In this template, you only need to do a couple of things to integrate your tool: Configure the build.sbt so it generates the docker to run your tool Extend the codacy.dockerApi.Tool trait Configuring build.sbt \u00b6 Our Scala template is built using sbt, which already has a great plugin to generate dockers, sbt-native-packager . To configure a docker, you should edit the build.sbt in the root directory of our template. One thing you probably want to change is the installAll value, which contains the commands to install the tools and all necessary dependencies. Implementing Tool trait \u00b6 When extending the Tool trait, you have to implement the apply method. When a client runs your tool, the apply method of our template is invoked. Here you have everything you need to invoke the tool. After you have your results from the tool, put them in our Result format, and then just return them. package codacy.mytool import scala.sys.process._ import codacy.dockerApi._ object MyTool extends Tool { override def apply ( path : Path , conf : Option [ Seq [ PatternDef ]], files : Option [ Set [ Path ]])( implicit spec : Spec ) : Try [ Iterable [ Result ]] = { //TODO: Your code goes here } } path: The root path where the files to test are located (usually /src ) conf: Patterns to run (optional) files: Files to test (optional), their path is relative to the path received spec: Tool configuration based on your patterns.json Important The behavior of your application method should vary depending on the optional parameters. If you receive no files , you should invoke the tool for all files from path (path is the root directory, files are searched recursively for all folders in path ). If you receive no conf , you should test with the default patterns. When receiving conf or files , you should only run your tool for the subset of patterns in conf and files in files . You must put each result in our Result type. The used types like PatternDef and Result are defined as case classes.

Note To know more about dockers, and how to write a docker file please refer to https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/ We use external tools at Codacy; in this tutorial, we explain how you can integrate the tool of your choice with our platform. You can check the code of an already implemented tool and, if you wish, fork it to start yours. You are free to modify it and use it for your integration. We also have a tutorial to integrate your tool using our Scala templates . Requirements \u00b6 Docker definition with the tool you want to integrate Define the documentation for the patterns provided by the tool Assumptions and behavior \u00b6 To run the tool we provide the configuration file, /src/.codacy.json , with the files you should analyze and also the patterns you should check. The files to analyse are located in /src , meaning that when provided in the configuration, the paths are relative to /src . .codacy.json files: Files to be analysed (their path is relative to /src) tools: Array of tools * name: Unique identifier of the tool patterns: Array of patterns that must be checked patternId: Unique identifier of the pattern parameters: Parameters of the pattern name: Unique identifier of the parameter value: Value to be used as parameter value { \"files\" : [ \"foo/bar/baz.js\" , \"foo2/bar/baz.php\" ], \"tools\" :[ { \"name\" : \"jshint\" , \"patterns\" :[ { \"patternId\" : \"latedef\" , \"parameters\" :[ { \"name\" : \"latedef\" , \"value\" : \"vars\" } ] } ] } ] } Important If /src/.codacy.json does not exist or any of its contents (files or patterns) is not available, you should invoke the tool for all files from /src (files should be searched recursively for all folders in /src ) and check them with the default patterns. When receiving /src/.codacy.json , you should only run your tool for the subset of files in files , and for the patterns present on patterns for your tool name . Setup \u00b6 Write the docker file that will run the tool. It must have a binary entry point without any parameters. Write a patterns.json with the configuration of your tool. This file must be located on /docs/patterns.json . name: Unique identifier of the tool (lower-case letters without spaces) patterns: The patterns that the tool provides patternId: Unique identifier of the pattern (lower-case letters without spaces) level: Severity level of the issue, one of Error , Warning , Info category: Category of the issue, one of ErrorProne , CodeStyle , UnusedCode , Security , Compatibility , Performance , Documentation parameters: Parameters received by the pattern name: Unique identifier of the parameter (lower-case letters without spaces) default: Default value of the parameter { \"name\" : \"jshint\" , \"patterns\" :[ { \"patternId\" : \"latedef\" , \"level\" : \"Error\" , \"category\" : \"UnusedCode\" , \"parameters\" :[ { \"name\" : \"latedef\" , \"default\" : \"vars\" } ] } ] } Note For level types we have: Error , Warning , Info For category types we have: ErrorProne , CodeStyle , UnusedCode , Security , Compatibility , Performance , Documentation Write the code to run the tool. You are free to write this code in the language you want. Here you have to invoke the tool according to the configuration. After you have your results from the tool, you should print them to the standard output in our Result format, one result per line. Important The filename should not include the prefix \"/src/\" Example: absolute path: /src/folder/file.js filename path: folder/file.js { \"filename\" : \"codacy/core/test.js\" , \"message\" : \"found this in your code\" , \"patternId\" : \"latedef\" , \"line\" : 2 } If you are not able to run the analysis for any of the files requested you should return an error for each one of them to the standard output in our Error format. { \"filename\" : \"codacy/core/test.js\" , \"message\" : \"could not parse the file\" , } Documentation \u00b6 At Codacy we strive to provide the best value to our users and, to accomplish that, we document our patterns so that the user can better understand the problem and fix it. At this point, your tool has everything it needs to run, but there is one other really important thing that you should do before submitting your docker: the documentation for your tool. Your files for this section should be placed in /docs/description/ . In order to provide more details you can create: A single /docs/description/description.json Optional: A /docs/description/<PATTERN-ID>.md for each pattern In the description.json you define the title for the pattern, brief description, time to fix (in minutes), and also a description of the parameters in the following format: [ { \"patternId\" : \"latedef\" , \"title\" : \"This is a title\" , \"description\" : \"This is a description\" , \"timeToFix\" : 5 , \"parameters\" :[ { \"name\" : \"latedef\" , \"description\" : \"this is a param description\" } ] } ] Optional: To give a more detailed explanation about the issue, you should define the <PATTERN-ID>.md . Fields in interfaces are automatically public static final, and methods are public abstract. Classes or interfaces nested in an interface are automatically public and static (all nested interfaces are automatically static). For historical reasons, modifiers which are implied by the context are accepted by the compiler, but are superfluous. Ex: public interface Foo { public abstract void bar(); // both abstract and public are ignored by the compiler public static final int X = 0; // public, static, and final all ignored public static class Bar {} // public, static ignored public static interface Baz {} // ditto void foo(); //this is correct } public class Bar { public static interface Baz {} // static ignored } [Source](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/pmd-5.3.2/pmd-java/rules/java/unusedcode.html#UnusedModifier) You should explain the *what* and *why* of the issue. Adding an example is always a nice way to help other people understand the problem. For a more thorough explanation you can also add a link at the end referring a more complete source. Tests \u00b6 After all the docker is prepared you can now test your work. To do it you should write test files and place them in /docs/tests , for example for PHP, /docs/tests/UnusedModifier.php .

At this point, your tool has everything it needs to run, but there is one other really important thing that you should do before submitting your docker: the documentation for your tool. Your files for this section should be placed in /docs/description/ . In order to provide more details you can create: A single /docs/description/description.json Optional: A /docs/description/<PATTERN-ID>.md for each pattern In the description.json you define the title for the pattern, brief description, time to fix (in minutes), and also a description of the parameters in the following format: [ { \"patternId\" : \"latedef\" , \"title\" : \"This is a title\" , \"description\" : \"This is a description\" , \"timeToFix\" : 5 , \"parameters\" :[ { \"name\" : \"latedef\" , \"description\" : \"this is a param description\" } ] } ] Optional: To give a more detailed explanation about the issue, you should define the <PATTERN-ID>.md . Fields in interfaces are automatically public static final, and methods are public abstract. Classes or interfaces nested in an interface are automatically public and static (all nested interfaces are automatically static). For historical reasons, modifiers which are implied by the context are accepted by the compiler, but are superfluous. Ex: public interface Foo { public abstract void bar(); // both abstract and public are ignored by the compiler public static final int X = 0; // public, static, and final all ignored public static class Bar {} // public, static ignored public static interface Baz {} // ditto void foo(); //this is correct } public class Bar { public static interface Baz {} // static ignored } [Source](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/pmd-5.3.2/pmd-java/rules/java/unusedcode.html#UnusedModifier) You should explain the *what* and *why* of the issue.

To upgrade Codacy, follow these instructions . Breaking changes \u00b6 This version of Codacy Self-hosted introduces the following breaking changes: You must manually delete the existing RabbitMQ PVCs before upgrading Codacy. To do this, start by removing the RabbitMQ statefulset: kubectl delete sts/codacy-rabbitmq-ha -n codacy Confirm the name of the PVCs that were created by RabbitMQ: kubectl get pvc -n codacy Finally, delete all the PVCs related to RabbitMQ. You should have three replicas which was the default for versions older than 2.0.0: kubectl delete pvc data-codacy-rabbitmq-ha-0 -n codacy kubectl delete pvc data-codacy-rabbitmq-ha-1 -n codacy kubectl delete pvc data-codacy-rabbitmq-ha-2 -n codacy Important After you upgrade Codacy, our chart will install a new version of RabbitMQ with the new default of one replica . The structure of the file values-production.yaml changed. You must update your version of the file to match the structure of the new file: The following analysis workers configuration values moved from: worker-manager : config : workers : [ ... ] workerResources : [ ... ] pluginResources : [ ... ] To: global : workerManager : workers : config : [ ... ] workerResources : [ ... ] pluginResources : [ ... ] The following database configuration values moved from: hotspots-api : hotspotsdb : [ ... ] activities : activitiesdb : [ ... ] crow : crowdb : [ ... ] To: global : hotspotsdb : [ ... ] activitiesdb : [ ... ] crowdb : [ ... ] The following Erlang cookie configuration was added to the RabbitMQ configuration values: rabbitmq-ha : rabbitmqErlangCookie : <--- erlang-cookie ---> # Generate one with `cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1` [ ... ] When you previously installed Codacy, this cookie was automatically set to a random value. We recommend that you keep the same cookie to help ensure that the Codacy upgrade runs smoothly. Run the following command to retrieve the current cookie value and define it explicitly in the new configuration: kubectl get secrets -n codacy codacy-rabbitmq-ha -o jsonpath = \"{.data.rabbitmq-erlang-cookie}\" | base64 --decode Product enhancements \u00b6 The chart for Codacy Self-hosted now supports Helm 3.3 . Updated the RabbitMQ chart to version 7.5.7 from the Bitnami Helm chart repository. Updated the MinIO chart to version 5.0.33 from the stable Helm chart repository. Bug fixes \u00b6 Now, Codacy provides feedback if the Country field is empty while updating the invoice details for an organization. (CY-2600) Fixed an issue that prevented users from finishing the onboarding process unless they added a Git provider organization. (CY-2580) Fixed an issue that prevented Codacy from loading the organization data from the Git provider during the onboarding process. (CY-2572) Fixed an issue that prevented Codacy from sending commit and pull request notification emails to members of an organization. (CY-2467) Fixed an issue that could cause Codacy to display an HTTP 404 error page instead of the Repositories page for an organization. (CY-2356) Fixed an issue that could cause Codacy to stop syncing Bitbucket Cloud repositories and updating pull requests in those repositories. (CY-2355) Fixed an issue that could prevent new users from starting the onboarding wizard. (CY-2288) Now, Codacy automatically navigates to the Organizations page after deleting an organization.

We arrange them in six categories. For every issue, we present information on why is this an issue, how you could solve it, and the related code pattern. 1. Issue Categories \u00b6 Security: security issues, potential vulnerabilities, unsafe dependencies. Error Prone: bad practices/patterns that cause code to fail/prone to bugs. Code Style: related to the style of the code, line length, tabs vs spaces. Compatibility: identifies code that has problems with older systems or cross platform support. Unused Code: unnecessary code not being used. Performance: inefficiently written code. 2. Issue Level \u00b6 Info: The least critical issue type will appear as blue; for example code style issues are shown this way. Warning: This issue type will appear as yellow. You should be careful with these ones, they are based on code standards and conventions. Error: The more dangerous types of issues will show as red. Take your time to fix these, although the code may run, these issues show the code that is very susceptible to problems. These issues are bug-prone, and/or can have serious problems regarding security and compatibility. Each pattern has a pre-defined severity level and at the moment, it\u2019s not possible to customize that information. 3. Ignoring an issue \u00b6 For an issue you disagree with or false positives, you can either ignore that instance or disable the pattern across the whole repository. To do so, click on cog wheel and select the desired option: 3.1. Reinstating ignored issues \u00b6 To reinstate ignored issues, click on the Current Issues box, and select Ignored Issues from the drop-down menu. 4.

Git submodules are helpful in maintaining a shared configuration file for your team, and then applying it to multiple Git repositories. Enabling submodules \u00b6 By default, Codacy does normal Git clones that do not include submodules to ensure that we only clone necessary repositories. However, if your organization needs to use submodules, you can contact support@codacy.com asking to enable submodules on Codacy. After we enabled submodules for your organization, do the following: If you are using Codacy Self-hosted , you must update the license . If your submodules are: Public repositories , make sure that your Git URL uses the HTTPS protocol Private repositories , make sure that your Git URL uses the SSH protocol. If you already have repositories on Codacy where you want to use submodules, navigate to the page Settings and click the button Generate New User Key for each of these repositories. Important If you're using Bitbucket Cloud , you must manually add the SSH key on your user account . When you add a repository to Codacy, Codacy adds a new SSH key to your repository using an integration with your Git provider. Codacy uses this SSH key every time it needs to clone that repository. When you are using submodules, Codacy needs to clone additional repositories it has no access to. Since there is no way of identifying the submodules of a repository before cloning the repository, Codacy adds the SSH keys to the user account so that it has access to the same repositories as the user. If you're using submodules to share an analysis tool configuration file across your repositories, check if your tool recursively searches the subdirectories of your repositories for configuration files. If your tool does not detect the configuration files in the submodule directories, you must include a configuration file directly in the root of your repositories referencing the configuration files in the submodule directories. Using submodules on new repositories \u00b6 You must repeat steps 2 to 4 above every time you add new repositories with submodules to Codacy.
