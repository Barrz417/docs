Below we also provide guidance on resource provisioning for typical scenarios . For a custom hardware resource recommendation, please contact us at support@codacy.com . Codacy architecture # You can look at Codacy separately as two groups of components: The \"Platform\" contains the UI and other components important to treat and show results The \"Analysis\" is the swarm of workers that run between one and four linters simultaneously, depending on factors such as the number of files or the programming languages used in your projects Since all components are running on a cluster, you can increase the number of pod replicas in every deployment to give you more resilience and throughput, at a cost of increased resource usage. The following is a simplified overview of how to calculate resource allocation for the group of components \"Platform\" and \"Analysis\": Group of components vCPU Memory Platform (1 pod replica per component) 4 8 GB Analysis (1 Analysis Worker pod with up to 4 linters) 5 (per Analysis Worker) 10 GB (per Analysis Worker) Standard cluster provisioning # As described in the section above, Codacy's architecture allows scaling the \"Analysis\" group of components, meaning that the resources needed for Codacy depend mainly on the rate of commits done by your team that Codacy will be analyzing. The resources recommended on the following table are based on our experience and are also the defaults in the values-production.yaml file. You might need to adapt these defaults taking into account your use case. In particular, you should set the value of global.workerManager.workers.config.dedicatedMax to the maximum number of concurrent analysis depending on the available resources and number of replicas per component. Note For MicroK8s clusters we added an extra 1.5 vCPU and 1.5 GB memory to the \"Platform\" to account for the MicroK8s platform itself running on the same machine. Installation type Pod replicas per component Max. concurrent analysis Platform resources Analysis resources ~ Total resources Kubernetes Small Installation 1 2 4 vCPUs 8 GB RAM 10 vCPUs 20 GB RAM 16 vCPUs 32 GB RAM Kubernetes Medium Installation (default) 2 4 8 vCPUs 16 GB RAM 20 vCPUs 40 GB RAM 32 vCPUs 64 GB RAM Kubernetes Big Installation 2+ 10+ 8+ vCPUs 16+ GB RAM 50+ vCPUs 100+ GB RAM 60+ vCPUs 110+ GB RAM MicroK8s Minimum 1 2 5.5 vCPUs 9.5 GB RAM 10 vCPUs 20 GB RAM 16 vCPUs 32 GB RAM MicroK8s Recommended (default) 1+ 2 9.5+ vCPUs 17.5+ GB RAM 10 vCPUs 20 GB RAM 21+ vCPUs 40+ GB RAM The storage requirements recommended on the following table depend mainly on the number of repositories that Codacy will be analyzing and should be used as a guideline to determine your installation requirements. Component Bundled in the chart? Minimum recommended NFS Yes 200 GB RabbitMQ Yes 8 GB Minio Yes 20 GB PostgreSQL No (external DB recommended) 500 GB+ Note Please note that due to the way Codacy works, a small number of pods will run in privileged mode with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability. This is required to allow the Worker pods to serve NFS shares to be mounted by the pods running the static code analysis tools. PostgreSQL server setup # Codacy requires a database server to persist data that must satisfy the following requirements: The infrastructure hosting the database server must be provisioned with the hardware requirements described below The DBMS server must be PostgreSQL version 11.20 The PostgreSQL server must be configured to accept connections from the cluster The Codacy databases and a dedicated user must be created using the instructions below Important Google, the developer of Kubernetes, doesn't recommend running database servers on your cluster . As such, consider using a managed solution like Amazon RDS or Google Cloud SQL, or running the PostgreSQL server on a dedicated virtual machine. We recommend that you use a managed solution to reduce maintenance and configuration costs of the PostgreSQL server. The main cloud providers all have this service that you can use, for example: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL or Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition Azure Database for PostgreSQL Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL Digital Ocean Managed Databases PostgreSQL hardware requirements # The following are the minimum specifications recommended for provisioning the PostgreSQL server: vCPUs Memory Storage Max. concurrent connections 4 8 GB 500 GB+ 300 Preparing PostgreSQL for Codacy # Before installing Codacy you must create a set of databases that will be used by Codacy to persist data. We also recommend that you create a dedicated user for Codacy, with access permissions only to the databases that are specific to Codacy: Connect to the PostgreSQL server as a database admin user. For example, using the psql command line client: psql -U postgres -h <PostgreSQL server hostname> Create the dedicated user that Codacy will use to connect to PostgreSQL. Make sure that you change the username and password to suit your security needs: CREATE USER codacy WITH PASSWORD 'codacy' ; ALTER ROLE codacy WITH CREATEDB ; Take note of the username and password you define, as you will require them later to configure the connection from Codacy to the PostgreSQL server. Make sure that you can connect to the PostgreSQL database using the newly created user. For example, using the psql command line client: psql -U codacy -d postgres -h <PostgreSQL server hostname> Create the databases required by Codacy: CREATE DATABASE accounts WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE analysis WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE results WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE metrics WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE filestore WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE jobs WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE listener WITH OWNER = codacy ; CREATE DATABASE crow WITH OWNER = codacy ;", "title": "System requirements"}, {"location": "chart/requirements/#system-requirements", "text": "Before installing Codacy Self-hosted you must ensure that you have the following infrastructure correctly provisioned and configured: Git provider Kubernetes or MicroK8s cluster PostgreSQL server The next sections describe in detail how to set up these prerequisites.", "title": "System requirements"}, {"location": "chart/requirements/#git-provider", "text": "To use Codacy Self-hosted, you must use one or more of our supported Git providers .

This solution is considerably more resource demanding than Crow, and is recommended only for more advanced usage. Furthermore, its installation, configuration, and management require a deeper knowledge of Kubernetes as each component must be carefully tweaked to match your specific use case, using as starting point the .yaml values files provided by us. The instructions below cover the basic installation of these monitoring services using the Kube Prometheus Stack . Important If you're using MicroK8s run alias kubectl=microk8s.kubectl . 1. Install custom resources # Add the custom resources required for installing the monitoring bundle in your cluster: kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/v0.58.0/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_alertmanagerconfigs.yaml kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/v0.58.0/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_alertmanagers.yaml kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/v0.58.0/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_podmonitors.yaml kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/v0.58.0/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_probes.yaml kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/v0.58.0/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheuses.yaml kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/v0.58.0/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_prometheusrules.yaml kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/v0.58.0/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_servicemonitors.yaml kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/v0.58.0/example/prometheus-operator-crd/monitoring.coreos.com_thanosrulers.yaml 2. Installing Loki # Obtain the configuration file for Loki, values-loki.yaml , and install it by running the command below. While the default storage class setting for Loki persistence should suit most use cases, you may need to adjust it to your specific Kubernetes installation. For instance, for MicroK8s use storageClassName: microk8s-hostpath . helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts kubectl create namespace monitoring helm upgrade --install --atomic --timeout 600s loki grafana/loki \\ --version 2 .14.1 --namespace monitoring --values values-loki.yaml 3. Installing Promtail # Promtail is an agent that ships the contents of local logs to a Loki instance. Obtain the configuration file for Promtail, values-promtail.yaml , and install it by running the command below. helm upgrade --install --atomic --timeout 600s promtail grafana/promtail \\ --version 2 .2.0 --namespace monitoring --values values-promtail.yaml 4. Installing Prometheus and Grafana # Obtain the configuration file for the Kube Prometheus Stack , values-prometheus-operator.yaml . Then: Edit the Grafana password for the admin user and the hostname for Grafana in the values-prometheus-operator.yaml file. Install the bundle on your cluster by running the command below. helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts helm repo update helm upgrade --install --atomic --timeout 600s monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \\ --version 39 .9.0 --namespace monitoring --values values-prometheus-operator.yaml Grafana will be available on the domain you configured in your values-prometheus-operator.yaml file, with Prometheus and Loki configured as datasources. Follow the Kubernetes documentation if you need to access other monitoring services that are now running on your cluster, using the method that best suits your use case. 5. Enable service dashboards # Now that you have Prometheus and Grafana installed you can enable metrics reporting for Codacy components.

Set up the Terraform state storage backend # The backend stores the current and historical state of your infrastructure. Although using the backend is optional, we recommend that you deploy it, particularly if you're planning to use these Terraform templates to make modifications to the cluster in the future: Initialize Terraform and deploy the infrastructure described in the backend/ directory, then follow Terraform's instructions: cd backend/ terraform init && terraform apply This creates an Amazon S3 bucket with a unique name to save the infrastructure state. Take note of the value of state_bucket_name in the output of the command. Edit the main/config.tf file and follow the instructions included in the comments to set the name of the Amazon S3 bucket created above and enable the use of the backend in those infrastructure stacks. 3.

Consider if you want to tailor the cluster to your needs by customizing the cluster configuration. The cluster configuration (such as the type and number of nodes, network CIDRs, etc.) is exposed as variables in the main/variables.tf file. To customize the defaults of that file we recommend that you use a variable definitions file and set the variables in a file named terraform.tfvars in the directory main/ . The following is an example terraform.tfvars : some_key = \"a_string_value\" another_key = 3 someting_else = true Subsequently running terraform apply loads the variables in the terraform.tfvars file by default: terraform apply Set up the kubeconfig file that stores the information needed by kubectl to connect to the new cluster by default: aws eks update-kubeconfig --name codacy-cluster --alias codacy-cluster Get information about the pods in the cluster to test that the cluster was created and that kubectl can successfully connect to the cluster: kubectl get pods -A 4.

A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly tested and has a lower chance of containing software bugs than a program with low code coverage. You can read more about the basics of code coverage on Codacy's blog. To monitor the code coverage of your repository on Codacy you must generate coverage reports for each commit on your CI/CD workflow, and then upload the coverage data to Codacy. Complete these main steps to set up coverage for your repository: Generating coverage reports Ensure that you're generating one of the code coverage report formats supported by Codacy on each push to your repository. Uploading coverage data to Codacy After each push to your repository, run the Codacy Coverage Reporter to parse your report file and upload the coverage data to Codacy. Validating that the coverage setup is complete Check if Codacy displays the coverage metrics for new commits and pull requests and troubleshoot the coverage setup if necessary. The next sections include detailed instructions on how to complete each step of the setup process. 1. Generating coverage reports # Before setting up Codacy to display code coverage metrics for your repository you must have tests and use tools to generate coverage reports for the source code files in your repository. Consider the following when generating coverage reports for your repository: There are many tools that you can use to generate coverage reports, but you must ensure that the coverage reports are in one of the formats that Codacy supports If your repository includes multiple programming languages, you may need to generate a separate coverage report for each language depending on the specific languages and tools that you use Make sure that you generate coverage reports that include coverage data for all source code files in your repository, and not just the files that were changed in each commit The following table contains example coverage tools that generate reports in formats that Codacy supports: Language Example coverage tools Report files C# OpenCover opencover.xml (OpenCover) dotCover CLI dotcover.xml (dotCover detailedXML ) Coverlet Make sure that you output the report files in a supported format using one of the following file names: opencover.xml (OpenCover) cobertura.xml (Cobertura) lcov.info , lcov.dat , *.lcov (LCOV) Go Golang Code Coverage Golang report files don't have a specific name. Because of this, later in the setup process you must follow specific instructions while submitting coverage to Codacy. Java JaCoCo jacoco*.xml (JaCoCo) Cobertura cobertura.xml (Cobertura) JavaScript Istanbul Mocha + Blanket.js lcov.info , lcov.dat , *.lcov (LCOV) PHP PHPUnit coverage-xml/index.xml (PHPUnit XML version <= 4) clover.xml (Clover) Python Coverage.py cobertura.xml (Cobertura) Ruby SimpleCov cobertura.xml (Cobertura) lcov.info , lcov.dat , *.lcov (LCOV) Scala sbt-jacoco jacoco*.xml (JaCoCo) scoverage cobertura.xml (Cobertura) Swift/Objective-C Xcode Code Coverage See below how to generate coverage reports with Xcode Handling unsupported languages # If you're generating a report format that Codacy doesn't support yet, contribute with a parser implementation yourself or use one of the community projects below to generate coverage reports in a supported format: SlatherOrg/slather : generate Cobertura reports from Xcode coverage reports: gem install slather slather coverage -x --output-directory <report-output-dir> --scheme <project-name> <project-name>.xcodeproj This will generate a file cobertura.xml inside the folder <report-output-dir> . dariodf/lcov_ex : generate LCOV reports for Elixir projects chrisgit/sfdx-plugins_apex_coverage_report : generate LCOV or Cobertura reports from Apex code coverage data danielpalme/ReportGenerator : convert between different report formats Important Make sure that you specify the language when uploading coverage for an unsupported language. As a last resort, you can also send the coverage data directly by calling one of the following Codacy API endpoints: saveCoverage saveCoverageWithAccountToken 2. Uploading coverage data to Codacy # After having coverage reports set up for your repository, you must use the Codacy Coverage Reporter to upload them to Codacy. The recommended way to do this is by using a CI/CD platform that automatically runs tests, generates coverage, and uses the Codacy Coverage Reporter to upload the coverage report information for every push to your repository. Alternative ways of running the Codacy Coverage Reporter Codacy makes available alternative ways to run the Codacy Coverage Reporter , such as by installing the binary manually or by using Docker, a GitHub Action, or a CircleCI Orb. However, the instructions on this page assume that you'll run the recommended self-contained bash script get.sh to automatically download and run the most recent version of the Codacy Coverage Reporter. Set up an API token to allow Codacy Coverage Reporter to authenticate on Codacy: If you're setting up coverage for one repository , obtain a project API token and set the following environment variable to specify your project API token: export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN = <your project API token> If you're setting up and automating coverage for multiple repositories , obtain an account API Token and set the following environment variables: CODACY_API_TOKEN: Your account API token. CODACY_ORGANIZATION_PROVIDER: Git provider hosting the repository. Must be one of gh , ghe , gl , gle , bb , or bbe to specify GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Enterprise, Bitbucket, or Bitbucket Enterprise, respectively. CODACY_USERNAME: Name of your organization on the Git provider, or your username on the Git provider if you're using a personal organization. CODACY_PROJECT_NAME: Name of the repository for which you're uploading the coverage data. export CODACY_API_TOKEN = <your account API token> export CODACY_ORGANIZATION_PROVIDER = <Git provider hosting the repository> export CODACY_USERNAME = <organization name or username on the Git provider> export CODACY_PROJECT_NAME = <repository name> Warning Never write API tokens to your configuration files and keep your API tokens well protected, as they grant owner permissions to your projects on Codacy We recommend that you set API tokens as environment variables. Check the documentation of your CI/CD platform on how to do this. If you're using Codacy Self-hosted set the following environment variables to specify your Codacy instance URL and the Codacy Coverage Reporter version that's compatible with Codacy Self-hosted 12.0.0: export CODACY_API_BASE_URL = <your Codacy instance URL> export CODACY_REPORTER_VERSION = 13 .13.1 Run Codacy Coverage Reporter on the root of the locally checked out branch of your Git repository , specifying the relative path to the coverage report to upload: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report -r <coverage report file name> Check the console output to validate that the Codacy Coverage Reporter detected the correct commit SHA-1 hash and successfully uploaded the coverage data to Codacy. If you need help, check the troubleshooting page for solutions to the most common issues while running the CLI. Note Be sure to also check the instructions for more advanced scenarios while uploading the coverage data to Codacy, such as when running parallel tests, using monorepos, or testing source code in multiple or unsupported languages. 3. Validating that the coverage setup is complete # Codacy displays the code coverage in each branch, as well as the evolution of code coverage between commits and the code coverage variation introduced by pull requests. Because of this, to ensure that all code coverage metrics are available on Codacy, you must have successfully uploaded coverage data and analyzed: The last two commits in each branch The common ancestor commit of each pull request branch and its target branch Example The example below shows that after pushing a commit that correctly sets up coverage on the default branch: Codacy will report coverage metrics for all subsequent commits and pull requests relative to the default branch. Codacy won't report coverage metrics for commits and pull requests that are relative to older branches where the coverage setup wasn't performed yet. To solve this issue, you can rebase the old feature branch to update the common ancestor commit to one that already has coverage data. Follow these instructions to validate that your coverage setup is working correctly: On Codacy, open your Repository Settings , tab Coverage , and observe the list of the most recent 50 coverage reports in the section Test your integration . Make sure that Codacy receives and processes the coverage data successfully for at least two commits . If there are commits with a status different from Processed , please follow the troubleshooting instructions for the corresponding error status and click the button Test integration to display any new coverage reports uploaded to Codacy. Commit not found # Codacy doesn't have information about the commit associated with the coverage data. What causes the error? How to fix the error? Codacy didn't receive the webhook for that commit from the Git provider. Wait a few more minutes until Codacy detects the commit and the status will update automatically. If it takes more than 5 to 10 minutes for Codacy to detect the commit, the webhook call from the Git provider may have been lost. You can wait until you push a new commit or contact support@codacy.com asking us to sync the commits on Codacy with your Git provider. The commit SHA-1 hash sent while uploading coverage is wrong. Make sure that the Codacy Coverage Reporter detects the correct commit SHA-1 hash for the uploaded coverage data. Branch not enabled # The commit associated with the coverage data doesn't belong to any branch that Codacy is analyzing. What causes the error? How to fix the error? Coverage was uploaded for a commit that belongs to a branch that isn't analyzed by Codacy. Make sure that the branch or target branch for pull requests is enabled on Codacy . If Codacy is already analyzing the branch, make sure that the Codacy Coverage Reporter detects the correct commit SHA-1 hash for the uploaded coverage data. Coverage was uploaded for a commit that no longer belongs to any branch on the Git repository, for example after a rebase or squash merge. The error status is expected in this scenario and you can ignore it. Commit not analyzed # Due to technical limitations, Codacy only reports coverage for a commit after successfully completing the static code analysis of that commit. What causes the error? How to fix the error? Codacy hasn't finished analyzing the commit yet. Wait a few more minutes until Codacy completes the static code analysis for the commit and the status will update automatically. Codacy didn't analyze the commit on a private repository because the commit author isn't a member of the Codacy organization. Make sure that you add all commit authors as members of the Codacy organization . Codacy skipped analyzing the commit because there are more recent commits in the branch. Upload coverage data for the most recent commit in the branch. The setting Run analysis on your build server is on, but your client-side tools didn't upload results to Codacy. Make sure that your client-side tools run successfully and upload the results to Codacy to complete the analysis. Codacy ran into an error while analyzing the commit. Solve the issue that caused the analysis to fail (such as Codacy losing access to the repository ), or contact us at support@codacy.com asking for help. Final report not sent # Codacy is waiting to receive more coverage data before reporting the coverage for a commit. What causes the error? How to fix the error? Coverage was uploaded with the --partial flag but Codacy didn't receive the final notification. Make sure that after uploading all partial reports you send the final notification . Pending # Codacy is waiting to receive valid coverage data for the files in your repository. What causes the error? How to fix the error? The file paths in the coverage report don't match the ones on the repository Files page on Codacy. Make sure that the file paths included in your coverage report are relative to the root directory of your repository. For example, src/index.js . The uploaded coverage data only includes information for files that are ignored on Codacy . Check which files are ignored on Codacy and make sure that you're generating coverage reports for the correct files in your repository. Check that Codacy displays the coverage metrics for the latest commits and pull requests. If Codacy doesn't display the coverage variation metric in pull requests (represented by - ), make sure that you have uploaded coverage data for both: The common ancestor commit of the pull request branch and the target branch The head commit of the pull request branch The following diagram highlights the commits that must have received coverage data for Codacy to display the coverage variation metric on a pull request: Need help? If you need help setting up coverage on your repository please contact us at support@codacy.com including the following information: URL of your repository on Codacy Your CI/CD configuration files and the name of your CI/CD platform Full console output of your CI/CD when running the Codacy Coverage Reporter Branch name and commit SHA-1 hash corresponding to the CI/CD output Test coverage report that you're uploading to Codacy Any other relevant information or screenshots of your setup", "title": "Adding coverage to your repository"}, {"location": "coverage-reporter/#adding-coverage-to-your-repository", "text": "Code coverage is a metric used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is tested.

Complete these main steps to set up coverage for your repository: Generating coverage reports Ensure that you're generating one of the code coverage report formats supported by Codacy on each push to your repository. Uploading coverage data to Codacy After each push to your repository, run the Codacy Coverage Reporter to parse your report file and upload the coverage data to Codacy. Validating that the coverage setup is complete Check if Codacy displays the coverage metrics for new commits and pull requests and troubleshoot the coverage setup if necessary. The next sections include detailed instructions on how to complete each step of the setup process.", "title": "Adding coverage to your repository"}, {"location": "coverage-reporter/#generating-coverage", "text": "Before setting up Codacy to display code coverage metrics for your repository you must have tests and use tools to generate coverage reports for the source code files in your repository. Consider the following when generating coverage reports for your repository: There are many tools that you can use to generate coverage reports, but you must ensure that the coverage reports are in one of the formats that Codacy supports If your repository includes multiple programming languages, you may need to generate a separate coverage report for each language depending on the specific languages and tools that you use Make sure that you generate coverage reports that include coverage data for all source code files in your repository, and not just the files that were changed in each commit The following table contains example coverage tools that generate reports in formats that Codacy supports: Language Example coverage tools Report files C# OpenCover opencover.xml (OpenCover) dotCover CLI dotcover.xml (dotCover detailedXML ) Coverlet Make sure that you output the report files in a supported format using one of the following file names: opencover.xml (OpenCover) cobertura.xml (Cobertura) lcov.info , lcov.dat , *.lcov (LCOV) Go Golang Code Coverage Golang report files don't have a specific name. Because of this, later in the setup process you must follow specific instructions while submitting coverage to Codacy.

Generating coverage reports"}, {"location": "coverage-reporter/#uploading-coverage", "text": "After having coverage reports set up for your repository, you must use the Codacy Coverage Reporter to upload them to Codacy. The recommended way to do this is by using a CI/CD platform that automatically runs tests, generates coverage, and uses the Codacy Coverage Reporter to upload the coverage report information for every push to your repository. Alternative ways of running the Codacy Coverage Reporter Codacy makes available alternative ways to run the Codacy Coverage Reporter , such as by installing the binary manually or by using Docker, a GitHub Action, or a CircleCI Orb. However, the instructions on this page assume that you'll run the recommended self-contained bash script get.sh to automatically download and run the most recent version of the Codacy Coverage Reporter. Set up an API token to allow Codacy Coverage Reporter to authenticate on Codacy: If you're setting up coverage for one repository , obtain a project API token and set the following environment variable to specify your project API token: export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN = <your project API token> If you're setting up and automating coverage for multiple repositories , obtain an account API Token and set the following environment variables: CODACY_API_TOKEN: Your account API token. CODACY_ORGANIZATION_PROVIDER: Git provider hosting the repository. Must be one of gh , ghe , gl , gle , bb , or bbe to specify GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, GitLab Enterprise, Bitbucket, or Bitbucket Enterprise, respectively. CODACY_USERNAME: Name of your organization on the Git provider, or your username on the Git provider if you're using a personal organization. CODACY_PROJECT_NAME: Name of the repository for which you're uploading the coverage data. export CODACY_API_TOKEN = <your account API token> export CODACY_ORGANIZATION_PROVIDER = <Git provider hosting the repository> export CODACY_USERNAME = <organization name or username on the Git provider> export CODACY_PROJECT_NAME = <repository name> Warning Never write API tokens to your configuration files and keep your API tokens well protected, as they grant owner permissions to your projects on Codacy We recommend that you set API tokens as environment variables. Check the documentation of your CI/CD platform on how to do this. If you're using Codacy Self-hosted set the following environment variables to specify your Codacy instance URL and the Codacy Coverage Reporter version that's compatible with Codacy Self-hosted 12.0.0: export CODACY_API_BASE_URL = <your Codacy instance URL> export CODACY_REPORTER_VERSION = 13 .13.1 Run Codacy Coverage Reporter on the root of the locally checked out branch of your Git repository , specifying the relative path to the coverage report to upload: bash < ( curl -Ls https://coverage.codacy.com/get.sh ) report -r <coverage report file name> Check the console output to validate that the Codacy Coverage Reporter detected the correct commit SHA-1 hash and successfully uploaded the coverage data to Codacy. If you need help, check the troubleshooting page for solutions to the most common issues while running the CLI. Note Be sure to also check the instructions for more advanced scenarios while uploading the coverage data to Codacy, such as when running parallel tests, using monorepos, or testing source code in multiple or unsupported languages.", "title": "2. Uploading coverage data to Codacy"}, {"location": "coverage-reporter/#validating-coverage", "text": "Codacy displays the code coverage in each branch, as well as the evolution of code coverage between commits and the code coverage variation introduced by pull requests. Because of this, to ensure that all code coverage metrics are available on Codacy, you must have successfully uploaded coverage data and analyzed: The last two commits in each branch The common ancestor commit of each pull request branch and its target branch Example The example below shows that after pushing a commit that correctly sets up coverage on the default branch: Codacy will report coverage metrics for all subsequent commits and pull requests relative to the default branch. Codacy won't report coverage metrics for commits and pull requests that are relative to older branches where the coverage setup wasn't performed yet. To solve this issue, you can rebase the old feature branch to update the common ancestor commit to one that already has coverage data. Follow these instructions to validate that your coverage setup is working correctly: On Codacy, open your Repository Settings , tab Coverage , and observe the list of the most recent 50 coverage reports in the section Test your integration . Make sure that Codacy receives and processes the coverage data successfully for at least two commits .

Usually, these drops in coverage happen in files that the commit or pull request didn't change. There are multiple reasons for this, but it's important to understand that each coverage report that you upload to Codacy contains information about which lines of code in your repository are tested or not in a specific commit. In particular, each coverage report provides the following information about the lines of your source code files: Coverable lines (lines that can be tested), by listing those lines Covered lines (lines that were tested at least once), by marking those lines as tested or having a number of test hits Not coverable lines (lines that can't be tested), by not listing those lines For example, the coverage report represented below includes coverage information for two source code files: File ClassA.java has two coverable lines and all are covered by tests File ClassB.java has three coverable lines but only line 1 is covered by tests File Line number Covered by tests? ClassA.java 2 Yes 4 Yes ClassB.java 1 Yes 3 No 11 No Based on the information obtained from the coverage reports, Codacy calculates code coverage as follows: The coverage for a file, commit, or pull request is the percentage of covered lines in the universe of coverable lines for that file, commit, or pull request. For example, a commit with 85 covered lines out of a total of 100 coverable lines has 85% coverage. The coverage variation of a commit or pull request is the increase or drop in the percentage of coverable lines that are covered by tests in the repository because of the changes of the commit or pull request. The diff coverage of a pull request is the percentage of coverable lines that the pull request added or modified that are covered by tests. If a pull request doesn't add or modify any coverable lines, the diff coverage is \u2205 (not applicable). This scenario happens when the only changes in a pull request are: Deleted lines Added or modified lines that aren't coverable Important Note that changes external to a source code file can affect the lines that are or aren't covered in that file. Common reasons for unexpected coverage changes # There are several reasons that could cause Codacy to report unexpected coverage results, from changes to your source code to external factors. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the most common reasons: Adding new tests or removing existing tests from your project. Even small and localized changes to your tests can have an impact on the amount of covered lines across your repository. Changing the logic of your application or tests. Changing the control flow of your application or tests can mean that different areas of your code start or stop being covered by tests. For example, inverting the result of the Boolean expression of an if statement means that a different branch of your code could now be tested. Failing to upload coverage reports, or uploading a different number of reports between commits. This can be caused by a failed step in your CI/CD pipeline, for example. In the case of pull requests, you should make sure that you upload all relevant coverage reports for both the common ancestor commit and the head commit of the pull request branch. Ignoring files on Codacy. Updating the list of ignored files can have an impact on the amount of coverable and covered lines of the commits that Codacy compares to calculate the coverage variation metric. External factors affecting the execution of tests. A variety of factors that are external to your code can affect the execution of tests and, consequently, the results contained in the coverage reports. A few examples of these external factors are: Updates to dependencies of your project that could result in different test execution paths Misconfiguration of repository secrets that could prevent some test execution paths Tests that are dependent on time, such as running test cases only on specific dates or times of the day \"Flaky\" tests caused by any inconsistent or unreliable behavior of your code, infrastructure, or third-party services The examples below describe in more detail how specific changes in your code impact the coverage metrics that Codacy calculates. Example: Diff coverage is 100% but pull request coverage variation is negative # Consider an example pull request where Codacy shows the following metrics: 100% diff coverage A negative coverage variation There are two possible scenarios that could cause this result: Removing covered lines or tests Since diff coverage only applies to covered lines that the pull request added or modified, removed lines don't affect the diff coverage metric. However, removing covered lines or tests means that there are now less covered lines in the repository, causing a drop in coverage. Application logic changes A change in the flow of execution of your application or tests can mean that a different number of coverable lines in your repository are now covered by tests, causing a drop in coverage. However, if all lines modified in the pull request continue to be covered, the diff coverage metric is 100%. The table below represents two example coverage reports reflecting a pull request that causes line 1 of the file ClassB.java to stop being covered: Common ancestor commit Head commit File Line number Covered by tests? Line number Covered by tests? ClassA.java 2 Yes 2 Yes 4 Yes 4 Yes ClassB.java 1 Yes 1 No 3 No 3 No 11 No 11 No The table below displays the code coverage metrics as calculated by Codacy: Initially, ClassB.java was 33.33% covered but after the changes from the pull request the file is now 0% covered, causing the repository coverage to drop 20% As long as the pull request also modified any covered line that continues to be covered, the diff coverage is 100% Common ancestor commit Head commit Pull request results File Coverable lines Covered lines Coverage Coverable lines Covered lines Coverage Coverage variation Diff coverage ClassA.java 2 2 100% 2 2 100% 0% ClassB.java 3 1 33.33% 3 0 0% -33.33% Total 5 3 60% 5 2 40% -20% 100% Example: Pull request coverage variation is negative but no files have coverage variation # Consider an example pull request where Codacy shows the following metrics: Negative coverage variation There aren't any files with coverage variation Removing covered lines from a file that had 100% coverage means that the file will continue to have 100% coverage. All lines in the file continue to be covered, even though there are now less covered lines. As such, there is no coverage variation for the file. However, since the proportion between the total number of covered and coverable lines across all files in the repository is now different, there can be a drop in the coverage variation for the pull request.

Usually, these drops in coverage happen in files that the commit or pull request didn't change. There are multiple reasons for this, but it's important to understand that each coverage report that you upload to Codacy contains information about which lines of code in your repository are tested or not in a specific commit. In particular, each coverage report provides the following information about the lines of your source code files: Coverable lines (lines that can be tested), by listing those lines Covered lines (lines that were tested at least once), by marking those lines as tested or having a number of test hits Not coverable lines (lines that can't be tested), by not listing those lines For example, the coverage report represented below includes coverage information for two source code files: File ClassA.java has two coverable lines and all are covered by tests File ClassB.java has three coverable lines but only line 1 is covered by tests File Line number Covered by tests? ClassA.java 2 Yes 4 Yes ClassB.java 1 Yes 3 No 11 No Based on the information obtained from the coverage reports, Codacy calculates code coverage as follows: The coverage for a file, commit, or pull request is the percentage of covered lines in the universe of coverable lines for that file, commit, or pull request. For example, a commit with 85 covered lines out of a total of 100 coverable lines has 85% coverage. The coverage variation of a commit or pull request is the increase or drop in the percentage of coverable lines that are covered by tests in the repository because of the changes of the commit or pull request. The diff coverage of a pull request is the percentage of coverable lines that the pull request added or modified that are covered by tests. If a pull request doesn't add or modify any coverable lines, the diff coverage is \u2205 (not applicable). This scenario happens when the only changes in a pull request are: Deleted lines Added or modified lines that aren't coverable Important Note that changes external to a source code file can affect the lines that are or aren't covered in that file.", "title": "Why does Codacy show unexpected coverage changes?"}, {"location": "faq/code-analysis/why-does-codacy-show-unexpected-coverage-changes/#common-reasons-for-unexpected-coverage-changes", "text": "There are several reasons that could cause Codacy to report unexpected coverage results, from changes to your source code to external factors. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the most common reasons: Adding new tests or removing existing tests from your project. Even small and localized changes to your tests can have an impact on the amount of covered lines across your repository. Changing the logic of your application or tests. Changing the control flow of your application or tests can mean that different areas of your code start or stop being covered by tests. For example, inverting the result of the Boolean expression of an if statement means that a different branch of your code could now be tested. Failing to upload coverage reports, or uploading a different number of reports between commits. This can be caused by a failed step in your CI/CD pipeline, for example. In the case of pull requests, you should make sure that you upload all relevant coverage reports for both the common ancestor commit and the head commit of the pull request branch. Ignoring files on Codacy. Updating the list of ignored files can have an impact on the amount of coverable and covered lines of the commits that Codacy compares to calculate the coverage variation metric. External factors affecting the execution of tests. A variety of factors that are external to your code can affect the execution of tests and, consequently, the results contained in the coverage reports. A few examples of these external factors are: Updates to dependencies of your project that could result in different test execution paths Misconfiguration of repository secrets that could prevent some test execution paths Tests that are dependent on time, such as running test cases only on specific dates or times of the day \"Flaky\" tests caused by any inconsistent or unreliable behavior of your code, infrastructure, or third-party services The examples below describe in more detail how specific changes in your code impact the coverage metrics that Codacy calculates.", "title": "Common reasons for unexpected coverage changes"}, {"location": "faq/code-analysis/why-does-codacy-show-unexpected-coverage-changes/#example-diff-coverage-is-100-but-pull-request-coverage-variation-is-negative", "text": "Consider an example pull request where Codacy shows the following metrics: 100% diff coverage A negative coverage variation There are two possible scenarios that could cause this result: Removing covered lines or tests Since diff coverage only applies to covered lines that the pull request added or modified, removed lines don't affect the diff coverage metric. However, removing covered lines or tests means that there are now less covered lines in the repository, causing a drop in coverage. Application logic changes A change in the flow of execution of your application or tests can mean that a different number of coverable lines in your repository are now covered by tests, causing a drop in coverage. However, if all lines modified in the pull request continue to be covered, the diff coverage metric is 100%.

Adding coverage to your repository (optional) # If you want to use code coverage to block merging pull requests that don't meet your quality standards, make sure that you add coverage to your repository . It's important that you set up coverage beforehand because Codacy can only report the coverage status for pull requests after receiving reports for the last commits on both the pull request branch and the target branch . 2. Reviewing and adjusting the Codacy analysis settings # We recommend that you spend some time reviewing the Codacy analysis settings to focus on the tools and code patterns that bring more value to your team. Importantly, this eliminates the risk of having false positives block the work of your team once you start using Codacy as a quality gate. Ignore any files and directories that aren't relevant for the Codacy analysis, such as generated code or any third-party libraries included in your repositories. Configure the tools and code patterns that Codacy uses to analyze your repository. Tip To ensure that multiple repositories consistently follow the same global tool and code pattern configurations, use an organization coding standard instead. 3. Configuring the quality gate rules # Review and adjust the quality settings of your repository to decide which pull requests should fail the Codacy quality gate. Depending on factors such as the current code quality of your repository and the maturity of your team practices, consider the balance between implementing stricter quality gates and the possibility of delaying or blocking the development progress. Tip The default values of the quality gate rules are designed to help maintain the current code quality of your repository. In particular, the default value for the coverage rule might be demanding. Because of this, Codacy generally recommends that on a first stage you configure rules that focus on stopping new critical issues from entering your code base, such as: High severity issues Security issues Considerable drops in code coverage Important If you want to use code coverage to block merging pull requests that don't meet your standards, make sure that you enable the rule Diff coverage is under or Coverage variation is under .

If you don't have any rules enabled for commits, the status is always Up to standards . The variation of the following code quality metrics introduced by the commit is displayed either as a positive or negative variation , or no variation (represented by = ): Issues: Number of new or fixed issues Duplication: Variation of the number of duplicated code blocks Complexity: Variation of complexity Coverage: Variation of code coverage percentage relative to the parent commit Depending on the languages being analyzed or if you haven't set up coverage for your repository , some metrics may not be calculated (represented by - ). Note Learn how Codacy calculates the code quality metrics in more detail: Which code quality metrics does Codacy calculate? Why does Codacy show unexpected coverage changes? The colors depend on the quality gate rules for your repository: Green: The metric passes the quality gate Red: The metric fails the quality gate Gray: There aren't quality gate rules configured for the metric or the value doesn't impact the quality gate Notes If you change the quality gate rules you must reanalyze the commit to update the color of the metrics, except for coverage which updates immediately after you save your changes on the Quality Settings page. Issues tabs # The New Issues and Fixed Issues tabs display the list of issues that the commit created or fixed. Click the title of an issue to see the following information: The contributor and date of the commit that introduced the issue The tool that reported the issue and the estimated time to fix it What's the issue and how to solve it The programming language and category of the issue Use the options in the cogwheel menu of each issue to ignore and manage issues . Possible issues # In some situations, Codacy may report either new or fixed possible issues on a commit, which means that the code analysis detected these issues in lines of code that weren't changed by that commit. This gives you awareness to how your changes may be affecting other parts of your code. The following are example situations that can lead to possible issues: The issue was either created or fixed in the current commit, but the static code analysis tools reported the issue on a line that didn't change in the commit. For example, if you remove the line containing the declaration of a variable you may get an \"undeclared variable\" issue in other lines that use that variable. If a file had more than 50 issues reported by the same tool and you push a new commit that fixes some of these issues, Codacy will report more issues until the limit of 50 issues. These issues will be possible issues if they're outside the lines of code changed in the new commit. Note If you're using GitHub you may see annotations for possible issues reported under Unchanged files with check annotations on the Files changed tab of your pull requests. This happens when Codacy reports possible issues in files that weren't changed in your pull request. Read more about this GitHub feature .

Possible issues # In some situations, Codacy may report either new or fixed possible issues on a pull request, which means that the code analysis detected these issues in lines of code that weren't changed by that pull request. This gives you awareness to how your changes may be affecting other parts of your code. The following are example situations that can lead to possible issues: The issue was either created or fixed in the current pull request, but the static code analysis tools reported the issue on a line that didn't change in the pull request. For example, if you remove the line containing the declaration of a variable you may get an \"undeclared variable\" issue in other lines that use that variable. If a file had more than 50 issues reported by the same tool and you push a new commit that fixes some of these issues, Codacy will report more issues until the limit of 50 issues. These issues will be possible issues if they're outside the lines of code changed in the new commit. Note If you're using GitHub you may see annotations for possible issues reported under Unchanged files with check annotations on the Files changed tab of your pull requests. This happens when Codacy reports possible issues in files that weren't changed in your pull request. Read more about this GitHub feature .

Supported security categories # Each issue reported on the Security Monitor belongs to one of the following security categories: Security category Description Android Android-specific security issues. Authentication Broken authentication and authorization attacks consist in gaining access to accounts that allow disclosing sensitive information or performing operations that could compromise the system. Command Injection Command injection attacks aim to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system. Cookies Security issues related to insecure cookies. Cryptography Cryptography attacks exploit failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof), potentially leading to exposure of sensitive data. CSRF Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks force an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. Denial of Service Denial of Service (DoS) attacks make a resource (site, application, server) unavailable for legitimate users, typically by flooding the resource with requests or exploiting a vulnerability to trigger a crash. File Access File access security issues may allow an attacker to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system such as application source code, configuration, and critical system files. HTTP Headers Insecure HTTP headers are a common attack vector for malicious users. Input Validation Client input should always be validated to prevent malformed or malicious data from entering the workflow of an information system. Insecure Modules and Libraries Security issues related to modules or libraries that can potentially include vulnerabilities. Insecure Storage Security issues related to insecure storage of sensitive data. Malicious Code Security issues related to code patterns that are potentially unsafe. Mass Assignment Unprotected mass assignments are a Rails feature that could allow an attacker to update sensitive model attributes. Regex Regular expressions can be used in Denial of Service attacks, exploiting the fact that in most regular expression implementations the computational load grows exponentially with input size. Routes Badly configured routes can give unintended access to an attacker. SQL Injection SQL injection attacks insert or \"inject\" malicious SQL queries into the application via the client input data. SSL Security issues related with old SSL versions or configurations that have known cryptographic weaknesses and should no longer be used. Unexpected Behaviour Security issues related to potentially insecure system API calls. Visibility Logging should always be included for security events to better allow attack detection and help defend against vulnerabilities. XSS Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks inject malicious client-side scripts into trusted websites that are visited by the end users. Other Other language-specific security issues.

File Access File access security issues may allow an attacker to access arbitrary files and directories stored on the file system such as application source code, configuration, and critical system files. HTTP Headers Insecure HTTP headers are a common attack vector for malicious users. Input Validation Client input should always be validated to prevent malformed or malicious data from entering the workflow of an information system. Insecure Modules and Libraries Security issues related to modules or libraries that can potentially include vulnerabilities. Insecure Storage Security issues related to insecure storage of sensitive data. Malicious Code Security issues related to code patterns that are potentially unsafe. Mass Assignment Unprotected mass assignments are a Rails feature that could allow an attacker to update sensitive model attributes. Regex Regular expressions can be used in Denial of Service attacks, exploiting the fact that in most regular expression implementations the computational load grows exponentially with input size. Routes Badly configured routes can give unintended access to an attacker. SQL Injection SQL injection attacks insert or \"inject\" malicious SQL queries into the application via the client input data. SSL Security issues related with old SSL versions or configurations that have known cryptographic weaknesses and should no longer be used. Unexpected Behaviour Security issues related to potentially insecure system API calls. Visibility Logging should always be included for security events to better allow attack detection and help defend against vulnerabilities. XSS Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks inject malicious client-side scripts into trusted websites that are visited by the end users.
