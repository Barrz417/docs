To install Codacy you must complete these main steps: Setting up the system requirements Ensure that your infrastructure meets the hardware and system requirements to run Codacy. Installing Codacy Install Codacy on the cluster using our Helm chart that includes all the necessary components and dependencies. Configuring Codacy Configure integrations with Git providers and set up monitoring. The next sections include detailed instructions on how to complete each step of the installation process. Make sure that you complete each step before advancing to the next one. 1. Setting up the system requirements \u00b6 Before you start, you must prepare and and provision the database server and Kubernetes or MicroK8s cluster that will host Codacy. Carefully review and set up the system requirements to run Codacy by following the instructions on the page below: System requirements Optionally, you can follow one of the guides below to quickly create a new Kubernetes or MicroK8s cluster that satisfies the characteristics described in the system requirements: Creating an Amazon EKS cluster Creating a MicroK8s cluster 2. Installing Codacy \u00b6 Install Codacy on an existing cluster using our Helm chart: Make sure that you have the following tools installed on your machine: kubectl within one minor version difference of your cluster Important If you are using MicroK8s you don't need to install kubectl because you will execute all kubectl commands as microk8s.kubectl commands instead. To simplify this, check how to create an alias for kubectl . Helm version 3.2 Create a cluster namespace called codacy that will group all resources related to Codacy. kubectl create namespace codacy Add the Docker registry credentials provided by Codacy together with your license to a cluster Secret. This is necessary because some Codacy Docker images are currently private. Substitute <docker_username> and <docker_password> with the Docker registry username and password and run the following command: kubectl create secret docker-registry docker-credentials \\ --docker-username = <docker_username> \\ --docker-password = <docker_password> \\ --namespace codacy Download the template file values-production.yaml {target=\"_blank\"} and use a text editor of your choice to edit the value placeholders as described in the comments. You can download the template file by running: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codacy/chart/master/codacy/values-production.yaml Create an address record on your DNS provider mapping the hostname you used in the previous step to the IP address of your Ingress controller. Important If you are using MicroK8s you must map the hostname to the public IP address of the machine running MicroK8s. Add Codacy's chart repository to your Helm client and install the Codacy chart using the file values-production.yaml created previously.

Below we also provide guidance on resource provisioning for typical scenarios . For a custom hardware resource recommendation, please contact us at support@codacy.com . Codacy architecture \u00b6 You can look at Codacy separately as two parts: The \"Platform\" contains the UI and other components important to treat and show results The \"Analysis\" is the swarm of workers that run between one and four linters simultaneously, depending on factors such as the number of files or the programming languages used in your projects Since all components are running on a cluster, you can increase the number of replicas in every deployment to give you more resilience and throughput, at a cost of increased resource usage. The following is a simplified overview of how to calculate resource allocation for the \"Platform\" and the \"Analysis\": Component vCPU Memory Platform (1 replica per component) 4 8 GB Analysis (1 Analysis Worker + up to 4 linters) 5 (per Analysis Worker) 10 GB (per Analysis Worker) Standard cluster provisioning \u00b6 The resources recommended on the following table are based on our experience and are also the defaults in the values-production.yaml file, which you might need to adapt taking into account your use case. As described in the section above, Codacy's architecture allows scaling the \"Analysis\" part of the platform, meaning that the resources needed for Codacy depend mainly on the rate of commits done by your team that Codacy will be analyzing. Important For MicroK8s clusters we added an extra 1.5 vCPU and 1.5 GB memory to the \"Platform\" to account for the MicroK8s platform itself running on the same machine.

Note that, as stated in the Terraform documentation , if your .aws/credentials are more complex you might need to set AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1 for Terraform to work correctly: export AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG = 1 Clone the Codacy chart repository and change to the directory that includes the provided Terraform configuration files: git clone https://github.com/codacy/chart.git cd chart/docs/infrastructure/EKS/ This folder includes the following infrastructure stacks: backend : Optional S3 bucket for storing the Terraform state and a DynamoDB table for state locking main : Amazon EKS cluster, including the setup of all network and node infrastructure to go from zero to a fully functional cluster You must have administration privileges on AWS to deploy (and eventually destroy) this infrastructure. The policy file aws-terraform-minimum-admin-policy.json lists the minimum privileges that are required. 2. Set up the Terraform state storage backend \u00b6 The backend stores the current and historical state of your infrastructure. Although using the backend is optional, we recommend that you deploy it, particularly if you are planning to use these Terraform templates to make modifications to the cluster in the future: Initialize Terraform and deploy the infrastructure described in the backend/ directory, then follow Terraform's instructions: cd backend/ terraform init && terraform apply This creates an Amazon S3 bucket with a unique name to save the infrastructure state. Take note of the value of state_bucket_name in the output of the command. Edit the main/config.tf file and follow the instructions included in the comments to set the name of the Amazon S3 bucket created above and enable the use of the backend in those infrastructure stacks. 3. Create a vanilla Amazon EKS cluster \u00b6 Create a cluster that includes all the required network and node setup: Initialize Terraform and deploy the infrastructure described in the main/ directory, then follow Terraform's instructions: cd ../main/ terraform init && terraform apply This process takes around 10 minutes. Consider if you want to tailor the cluster to your needs by customizing the cluster configuration. The cluster configuration (such as the type and number of nodes, network CIDRs, etc.) is exposed as variables in the main/variables.tf file. To customize the defaults of that file we recommend that you use a variable definitions file and set the variables in a file named terraform.tfvars in the directory main/ . The following is an example terraform.tfvars : some_key = \"a_string_value\" another_key = 3 someting_else = true Subsequently running terraform apply loads the variables in the terraform.tfvars file by default: terraform apply Set up the kubeconfig file that stores the information needed by kubectl to connect to the new cluster by default: aws eks update-kubeconfig --name codacy-cluster --alias codacy-cluster Get information about the pods in the cluster to test that the cluster was created and that kubectl can successfully connect to the cluster: kubectl get pods -A 4.

To unregister your repositories from Codacy and stop the analysis you must delete them from your Codacy account . If you need to use an integration that you have previously revoked, log in again to Codacy with that integration so that Codacy can request the required permissions from the provider.","title":"Revoking access to integrations"},{"location":"release-notes/cloud/bitbucket-changes/","text":"Bitbucket changes \u00b6 We are making some changes on the 18th Feb 2019 onwards that will cause all existing integrations with Bitbucket to stop working .

Below is the list of enhancements and bug fixes available with this update. Product Enhancements \u00b6 We now support Crystal language using Ameba As a way to improve performance we\u2019ve implemented an upper bound limit for file sizes that should be considered for analysis of 150 kb. This means that: Some projects that weren\u2019t analysing before will now be able to analyse Some projects will take less time to analyse Some projects will have less issues as third party libraries issues covered by this limit will not show Some projects will have more issues because the analysis batch in which they are inserted will not fail These files will not show in the UI as ignored Although most of the files that are now being ignored will be third-party dependencies and generated files, there is still the chance that some files that are actually development code and should be analysed won\u2019t be. If you have any files over this limit and consider necessary to analyze them, please reach out to us Another measure taken to improve performance was to remove the ability to add projects using Git url, however, any projects that were manually added prior to this release should continue to analyse as usual We added several additional configurable options to the control panel, so Codacy can be more easily adaptable to specific use cases: Public monitoring: you can now give Crow visibility to all users, instead of only Codacy Admins. This can be configured through the Control Panel -> Configure -> Monitoring Polling time; analysis inactivity timeout and Analysis tool timeout are now configurable values on the Control Panel: this may be useful, particularly if you have very large projects that take a long time to analyse, which may cause some tools to time out. If you\u2019re experiencing any troubles with your analysis, you should reach out and we\u2019ll assist with any necessary changes; Bug fixes \u00b6 Fixed a bug that was showing non-existent Stylelint patterns in the UI Fixed a bug where the default patterns 'Active' filter wasn\u2019t working in the Admin view Fixed a bug where the \u201cUnignore issue\u201d button wasn\u2019t working Fixed a bug related with duplicated ignored files which was slowing down the start of the analysis Fixed a bug where Codacy was making inconsistent comments to Gitlab, as in some occasions this would show as a list of issues and in other situations there would be comments in the actual line of code Fixed a bug that prevented users to save changes in project Settings when using Firefox 61 Fixed a bug in the project dashboard that where the link to \u201cSee all issues\u201d was broken Fixed a bug in Admin settings where the option to \"Allow all users to add projects\" behaviour was reversed Fixed a bug with analysis priorities that caused some projects ending up with negative priorities Fixed a bug with Cppcheck that was causing some analysis to fail, by adding a multithreaded flag to disable `unusedFunction` checking","title":"Enterprise v2.0.362"},{"location":"release-notes/self-hosted/enterprise-v2.0.362/#enterprise-v20362","text":"These updates won\u2019t be available if you are still using Codacy Legacy version.

The installer will configure the application to be able to run behind a proxy. After installation and engine downloads, you will be able to remove internet access from the machine running Codacy, as all analysis will be performed offline. What are the network requirements for Codacy for inbound and outbound traffic ports? \u00b6 You can find our network requirements here Logs show issues on DB connection: \"Cannot connect to DB [results]\" \u00b6 The most common cause for this is that the new DB is not created: Error in custom provider, Configuration error: Configuration error: Cannot connect to database [results] while locating play.api.db.DBApiProvider while locating play.api.db.DBApiWhile To fix this: 1 - Restart server 2 - Update the control panel: bash -c \" $( curl -fsSL https://getenterprise.codacy.com/get ) \" -s update 3 - Reload the application. It should show in the logs that it is running init scripts, and trying to create new DBs. As a workaround, you can do the exact same thing the scripts are doing: 1 - Get a psql connection to the server: docker run -it --rm postgres:9.4.5 sh -c 'exec psql -h \"172.17.0.1\" -p \"5432\" -U postgres' 2 - We should have several DBs created for Codacy: In the PSQL shell, run: CREATE DATABASE codacy_results WITH OWNER = codacy ; Our machine was restarted, and our DB IP changed. What now? \u00b6 Please be aware that a Postgres installation using Docker is not advised or supported. We strongly advise using a separate Postgres outside the Codacy machine in order to be able to upgrade/downgrade Docker and Codacy without losing data in the DB. The server should be considered stateless at all times. If you are using Postgres on Docker, the DB IP may change upon server restart. Although running Postgres in Docker is not supported for a production environment, you can have the system find the new database IP automatically by updating the IP of the DB in the config by setting it to: {{ conf.doplicated.var.internalhostip }} If you are not using DNS, you should set Host and Host Docker Ip to: {{ conf.doplicated.var.hostip }} {{ conf.doplicated.var.internalhostip }} The changes will be applied after you save and reload the application. Our machine was restarted, and now our configuration checks fail. \u00b6 Check the database IP settings and make sure they are all still valid. If the database is running on a Docker, its IP may have changed. If the problem is the \"Application Secret\" or \"Cache Secret,\" the values presented on the \"Configuration Check\" page should be applied on the Control Panel configuration tab. The changes will be applied after you save and reload the application. I get a \"Page not found\" error after uploading the application license. \u00b6 Currently, Codacy requires 2 different licenses: one is a .dlk file used in the installer, and another is .key file used in Codacy. If the dlk file is imported, it will fail to parse and throw an exception. Please navigate to URL http://YOUR_SERVER/license , where you should be able to introduce the correct file. My analyses are taking too long. Why? \u00b6 Docker version \u00b6 Please make sure you are running a supported version of Docker. Codacy currently supports versions 1.7.0 to 1.9.1. Version 1.10 is currently not supported and thus will not perform any analysis. Initial analysis on a repository may take a bit longer than usual. For a large repository, this may take up to 1 hour, depending on your server hardware. Even so, we find that over 90% of repositories are analysed in less than 5 minutes. If you find your repository taking longer than what would be expected for its size, there may be some issues with the Docker engine. If you find your analyses taking longer than expected, please reach out to us with your logs at support@codacy.com . Codacy doesn't seem to be analysing, and the container count is increasing. \u00b6 Please check for any engine updates in the Codacy Control Panel. If a new release is available, update Codacy and restart your server. The Codacy configuration panel shows an error related to my application secret. \u00b6 When the installer first runs on a server, it generates a random key and uses it to cipher all data stored in the DB, making sure that if partial table contents are shared, all information will be rendered useless. If you install a new server, you will need to use the same key as before. The configuration panel will then notify you of missed configurations and provide you with a usable key to be used in the configuration panel. Can we set up Codacy in a high availability or disaster recovery topology? \u00b6 For this, only the database needs to be high availability. The server has no state and can be replaced at any time. (If the machine dies, a new installation can be made and put up very quickly.) If your requirement is to have the app machine in high availability, you can have two or more installations hidden behind a load balancer. How do I update Codacy to the latest version? \u00b6 In the Codacy Control panel, click the option to \"update to the latest version\" Pull Dockers (do not leave this page until this task is completed) Run How do I update my license? \u00b6 Please be aware that unless you are running the latest version of Codacy, you will not be able to update the license successfully. Please see the section above for how to update to the latest version. Go to control panel home -> Check for updates Go to control panel home -> Configure -> click Save at the bottom of the page (no need to change any details) Go to control panel home -> Reload I updated my Docker version and Codacy stopped working. \u00b6 Note: This does not apply for Swarms. We currently support Docker versions 1.7.0 to 1.9.1 To remove an unsupported version and install a supported version: Stop the current Codacy application from the control panel SSH to the instance where you have Codacy installed and do the following steps: Remove previous docker installation sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io Remove docker data folder sudo mv /var/lib/docker/ /tmp sudo rm -rf /tmp/docker/ Run the Codacy script to reinstall Docker and Codacy bash -c \" $( curl -fsSL https://get.codacy.com/ ) \" Go back to the control panel and hit \"Configure.\" Make sure that your configuration is correct (you shouldn't have lost any configurations like DB host URL or https certificates), scroll to the bottom, and press \"Save\" Hit Start to make Codacy run again My question still isn't answered.

Setup should take around 20 minutes to complete. To have your setup fully functional, Codacy will need to download its plugins (e.g., its code analyzers) after running for the first time. This process can take up to an extra hour, depending on network speed. 1.1 - Hardware \u00b6 Recommended specifications : 16 core CPU 32GB RAM 1TB+ Hard Drive Disk space use: if your boot disk has very low capacity (something we often see on customers using sophisticated volume management): please mount /var/lib/docker on a volume with at least 100GB free capacity for Docker images; please mount the configured Codacy \"Temporary folder\" directory (which defaults to \"/tmp\") on your larger volume. This directory actually stores application data. Do not mount directories under \"/root\", as Codacy will not be able to chown them to the appropriate user Codacy's basic Docker images take around 15GB. However, with analysers, you may have over 20 GB of Docker images. We recommend larger disk capacity to accommodate upgrades with less frequent maintenance. Extra considerations for CPU and RAM: The default configuration is to run a maximum of 2 analyses in parallel. Our general advice is to have an extra 2 CPUs and 4GB RAM per additional running analysis. 1.2 - Database \u00b6 Required database: PostgreSQL 9.6.x Codacy requires a pre-installed PostgreSQL 9.6.x database, using a UTF-8 character set. We recommend installing this database on a separate machine. You can find setup instructions for this database here . It is also possible to set up a local PostgreSQL 9.6.x database, but please note that a local database is recommended for testing purposes only . If you would like to use a Docker-based database instance for this purpose (without data persistence between reboots), you can find setup instructions here . You can test the connection from the Codacy server to your database later on the setup process, just after you run the setup script the first time (which installs Docker) and before the second time (which installs the Codacy services), through PSQL running from a Docker container: shell docker run -it --rm postgres:9.4.5 sh -c 'exec psql -h \"<POSTGRESQL-HOST>\" -p \"<POSTGRESQL-PORT>\" -U <POSTGRESQL-USER>' 1.3 - Software \u00b6 We recommend installing Codacy on Ubuntu 16.04 . If you need to install Codacy on a different operating system, please contact us first . Although Docker aims at being environment-independent, not all Linux distributions fully support the Docker features that Codacy relies on to run. Installing Codacy on a different OS may yield unpredictable results, or it may not run at all. 1.4 - Other target machine prerequisites \u00b6 Before installing Codacy: There should be no pre-installed Docker; There should be no user with id 2004; There should be no user group with id 2004. User id 2004 and user group id 2004 are reserved for disk access privilege management, a limitation of running everything, including code analyzers included from Docker containers. 1.5 - Networking \u00b6 1.5.1 - IP addresses and DNS \u00b6 To simplify maintenance, you should have a fixed IP address and/or DNS names for the Codacy server and the services it integrates with before installation. If you only have dynamic IP addresses for the above servers, integrations will break every time the IP addresses change. If you change the Codacy server DNS configuration, you will have to reboot it (or, at least, reboot Docker). This is caused by a limitation of the Docker service which currently only picks up DNS configurations upon start. To check the DNS servers configured on your target machine: cat /etc/resolv.conf In order to add a new DNS server to this configuration, use the nameserver command: nameserver <some-ip-address> 1.5.2 - Ports to open for the Codacy server \u00b6 For the target machine, make sure you have these ports open for inbound network traffic before setting up Codacy: 80 [TCP] - Application HTTP 443 [TCP] - Application HTTPS 9000 [TCP] - Control Panel HTTP 9443 [TCP] - Control Panel HTTPS 16005 [TCP] - Monitoring (average analysis times, analysis queues, ...) 16006 [TCP] - Application API (coverage, ...) On the outbound traffic side, ensure that you can access the Internet from the Codacy server, including: getenterprise.codacy.com on ports 80 and 443 [TCP] (download application setup and update packages) index.docker.io on port 443 [TCP] (download application docker images) 1.5.3 - Database setup \u00b6 Please make sure: You can access the PostgreSQL server you installed on its configured [TCP] port, which 5432 by default. PostgreSQL is configured to accept connections from the Codacy server, as documented here . 1.5.4 - Access to servers you want to integrate with \u00b6 Ensure that: The Codacy server can access any services you want to integrate with (e.g, Gitlab, email servers) on their respective API / service ports; The services you want to integrate with can access the Codacy server. (The ports that must be open on the Codacy server are already enumerated above.) For a source code provider such as Gitlab, Github, or Bitbucket, you must open whatever ports are used on the source code hosting for http, https, git and ssh protocols. Example: For GitHub, you are required to allow TCP ports 22, 80, 443, and 9418 for applications to function, as documented here . 2 - Installation \u00b6 The installation is made with a one line shell script: bash -c \" $( curl -fsSL https://get.codacy.com/ ) \" This script will update the kernel and install the required Docker version to run Codacy. If you have previously installed Docker, please check the documentation on how to uninstall it before running this script. The script will need to restart the server to apply the changes. After the server restarts, run the same bash command as before: bash -c \" $( curl -fsSL https://get.codacy.com/ ) \" The script will detect that Docker is installed (it was installed with this script so you can ignore the warning) then ask for proxy configurations and whether a database should be installed. It will then proceed to install the Codacy Control Panel. Database Included \u00b6 Using the provided Postgres database will allow you to evaluate Codacy without having to properly install a Postgres database, but, as stated in the Postgres installation guide , this database is not supported for production environments. After this, you will be ready to start the configuration process in step 3. 3 - Configuration \u00b6 The configuration interface is web-based and can be accessed via port 9000 over HTTP (e.g., http://192.168.0.1:9000 ) of the server you have Codacy installed on (make sure that the port 9000 is accessible from your local computer). 3.1 - Server license \u00b6 The first screen will ask you for a license to be installed to access the application web UI. This will be a file with the extension .dlk . This will provide you with access to download a custom-built virtual infrastructure of Codacy that run in your own infrastructure. The license should be provided by a Codacy representative. 3.2 - Control panel \u00b6 After validating the license, you will be presented with the Codacy Control Panel, used to configure and update the application. Codacy Control Panel This console provides access to configuration keys and allows Codacy to be updated. We strongly advise that this console is secured against unwanted access. 3.4 Application updates \u00b6 For your initial application installation or future Codacy updates, click the button Check for Updates in the top right corner. If a new update is available, a new option will appear: New version available Before any new version is ready to start running, a manual check of configurations is required. To configure the new version, click on the Configure link in the upper right hand corner. This will open a new screen with every configuration key required to run Codacy. Application configuration Codacy will run with the default settings, so if you are just evaluating the product with the default database there is no need to change anything. If you would like to configure an external database, change the following settings: Mandatory settings to be reviewed Host IP and Host Docker IP are automatically evaluated, and secret keys to cipher database contents are created randomly per installation so no change is required. After configuring the application, hitting save will return you to the update screen. A new option to pull the version will be presented in the upper left corner: PULL option available Pressing Pull will start an async method that can take up to 30 minutes, depending on your internet connection. This will pull Codacy images from dockerhub, making them available in the local registry for application execution. When done, a success message will show in the logs, and refreshing the page will show a new option Run in the toolbar: Docker pulled and new RUN option Pressing RUN will start the application. At any time, you can check the status of Codacy by navigating to Support: Support screen There, all dockers will show their status. The download logs link will create a zip file with all container logs that can be used to debug your installation at any time. 3.4.1 - Updating the Control Panel \u00b6 Deprecated step \u00b6 Since Control Panel version 1.0.60 (released July 2016) the client is now able to update itself. Some updates might require the latest version of the control panel. To download the latest version, log in to the machine via SSH and execute: bash -c \" $( curl -fsSL https://getenterprise.codacy.com/get ) \" -s update After the installation is completed, you'll be able to access your server via HTTP on port 9000. There should be a new version running. 3.5 Running Codacy \u00b6 Database IP \u00b6 If the database IP is incorrectly configured, Codacy will try to do an initial connection and wait on this before enabling the HTTP server. If the server is inaccessible, this will render Codacy unavailable. You can navigate to port 80 (http) or port 443 (https) of your server in order to test your installation of Codacy. Codacy will provide you with a checkup page that will scan for any missed configuration setting. 3.6 Registration \u00b6 When all settings are correct, Codacy will ask you to accept the License Agreement. After accepting it, you will be redirected to the initial registration screen. The first user to register will automatically be an admin and will be able to administer the platform and create additional users. 3.7 Initial configuration \u00b6 Internet access \u00b6 At this point as the application has finished downloading all components, internet access can be removed from the machine if desired. Default patterns \u00b6 We highly suggest you now go to 'Admin > Patterns' to select the default patterns. These defaults will be applied to new repositories. Codacy is now ready to be used. 4.0 Additional configurations \u00b6 HTTP - Custom Port \u00b6 To change the default control panel port (9000), export the environment variable \"DOPLICATED_CLIENT_PORT\" before invoking the control panel update command. bash -c \" $( curl -fsSL https://getenterprise.codacy.com/get ) \" -s update HTTPS - Control Panel \u00b6 To access the control panel with HTTPS, upload your CSR file (without password) and the certificate key to the CSR file in the settings panel. By enabling the HTTPS settings, the control panel will be accessible through HTTPS and will use the configured port (9443 by default). HTTPS - Codacy \u00b6 To access Codacy with HTTPS, upload your CSR file (without password) and the certificate key to the CSR file in the settings panel. By enabling the HTTPS settings, the control panel will be accessible through HTTPS and will use the configured port (9443 by default). After this is complete, make sure you \"Save\" and click \"Reload\". HTTPS - Using HTTPS with an external load balancer \u00b6 If you would prefer to set up HTTPS via an external load balancer (for example: AWS Load balancers), there are additional steps for setup: Make sure the HTTP option is disabled in Codacy's Control Panel Ensure you have a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS Configure your git provider OAuth callback URL to use HTTP","title":"Installing Codacy Self-hosted"},{"location":"self-hosted/installing-codacy-self-hosted/#installing-codacy-self-hosted","text":"","title":"Installing Codacy Self-hosted"},{"location":"self-hosted/installing-codacy-self-hosted/#1-prerequisites","text":"Codacy works by using Docker in a containerized environment.

For more information see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/multibyte.html 1 - Postgres \u00b6 Here are some quick steps to have a running Postgres installation on Ubuntu 16.04. 1.1 - Configure system locale to support UTF-8 \u00b6 Before installing postgres, you'll need to make sure your system locale is configured to use UTF-8. You can check your current locale by running: locale You can change your locale to a UTF-8 variant by running: update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 1.2 - Install postgres \u00b6 First, ensure that you install postgres 9.6 following the instructions described here . 1.3 - Run postgres \u00b6 Installing PostgreSQL on Ubuntu should start the service by default. However, check that it's running with: sudo systemctl status postgresql If PostgreSQL is running, you'll see output that includes the text Active: active (exited) . If you see Active: inactive (dead) , start the PostgreSQL service using the following command: sudo systemctl start postgresql PostgreSQL also needs to be enabled to start on reboot. Do that with this command: sudo systemctl enable postgresql 1.4 - Allow external connections \u00b6 In order to access PostgreSQL from a different machine, you'll need to do additional configuration to allow external connections. Using Nano (or vim/emacs/other), edit your postgresql.conf file. We're specifically looking for a line that says listen_addresses . We're going to modify where PostgreSQL is listening. # /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/postgresql.conf #--------------------------------------------------------- # CONNECTIONS AND AUTHENTICATION #--------------------------------------------------------- # - Connection Settings - listen_addresses = '*' max_connections = 300 Next we're going to edit our pg_hba.conf file and configure it to allow remote connections. At the very end of the file, add the following line: # /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/pg_hba.conf host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5 This is a rule that basically tells PostgreSQL to allow anyone to access the instance as long as they have proper credentials. If you want to whitelist your IP only, you can use your network/mask instead of 0.0.0.0/0 (for example: 34.240.13.75/32). Note This is not recommended, but if you are running postgres on the same machine where Codacy is and want to whitelist just Codacy's IP address, you will have to whitelist a range of IP addresses. This is because Codacy runs inside Docker and won't have always the same IP address inside the Docker network. To do this, you should first obtain the address of the Docker network interface with an ifconfig and then whitelist the range ip addresses according to it (for example, 172.17.0.0/16) . Finally, restart postgres: sudo service postgresql restart Note Actual file locations may differ depending on what package and operating system you use. You can usually find your postgres conf file location by searching on Google. 1.5 - Creating a user \u00b6 It is advised that you create a unique user that will only be able to access Codacy-specific databases. To do so, using the psql shell, create a user: sudo -u postgres psql CREATE USER codacy WITH PASSWORD 'codacy' ; ALTER ROLE codacy WITH CREATEDB ; You can change the username/password to suit your security needs. Make sure that you can connect to the Postgres database using the newly created user. For additional settings, follow the steps in the Postgres documentation.

To see a detailed explanation you can click on Show Details in the top right corner (mouse over the pattern and the Show Details option will appear): The pattern explanation shows more detail about the issues it can detect and how to fix them. You can filter the patterns by category using the side menu: The issues detected by Codacy belong to one of the following categories: \u00b6 Code Style - Code formatting and syntax problems. Ex: variable name style, enforce the use of brackets and quotation marks Error Prone - Code that may hide bugs and language keywords that should be used with caution. Ex: == in Javascript or Option.get in Scala Code Complexity - Highly complex methods and classes that should be refactored Performance - Code that could have performance problems Compatibility - Used mainly for frontend code, detects compatibility problems across different browser versions Unused Code - Unused variables and methods, code that can't be reached Security - All security problems Documentation - Detects methods and classes that do not have the correct comment annotations 2.

They are helpful in maintaining a shared configuration file for your team, which can then be applied to multiple git repositories. Codacy supports this workflow for GitHub, Bitbucket (including Bitbucket Server) and GitLab. Note Some tools don't search for configuration files recursively. You may need to include a configuration file in the root of your repository referencing the configuration file in the submodule. Enabling submodules for Codacy Self-hosted \u00b6 By default we do normal git clones which will not clone submodules, this is to ensure that we only clone necessary repos. However if you're already using submodules this feature can be enabled by contacting our Support Team . After the submodules have been enabled, you will need to update the license . If your submodules are public repositories, please make sure your URL is using the HTTPS protocol. If your submodules are private, make sure your URL is using the SSH protocol. If you already have repositories added on Codacy that have submodules: Navigate to the Repository Settings tab Click the 'Generate New User Key' button for each repository. If you're using Bitbucket Cloud , you must click the link 'Add New User Key' instead and manually copy the SSH key to Bibucket Cloud. Don't forget to repeat these steps every time you add new repositories containing submodules to Codacy. Alternatively, you can make this the default behavior for all new repositories by turning on 'Add repository key to the user' in the Administration Settings. If you're using Bitbucket Cloud , since automatically adding the user keys is not supported this setting must be disabled. How does this work? When you add a repository to Codacy, it generates a new SSH key that is added to your repository using a GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab integration. Every time Codacy needs to clone that repository, this key is used. If you are using submodules, Codacy needs to clone an additional repository it has no access to. Since there is no way of identifying the submodules of a repository before cloning it, Codacy adds the SSH keys to the user\u2019s account, thus enabling access to all repositories the user has. Enabling submodules for Cloud \u00b6 It is only possible to enable submodules for Organization accounts. By default we do normal git clones that will not clone submodules, this is to ensure that we only clone necessary repos. However if your organization is already using submodules these can be enabled by contacting our Support Team .

However if you're already using submodules this feature can be enabled by contacting our Support Team . After the submodules have been enabled, you will need to update the license . If your submodules are public repositories, please make sure your URL is using the HTTPS protocol. If your submodules are private, make sure your URL is using the SSH protocol. If you already have repositories added on Codacy that have submodules: Navigate to the Repository Settings tab Click the 'Generate New User Key' button for each repository. If you're using Bitbucket Cloud , you must click the link 'Add New User Key' instead and manually copy the SSH key to Bibucket Cloud. Don't forget to repeat these steps every time you add new repositories containing submodules to Codacy. Alternatively, you can make this the default behavior for all new repositories by turning on 'Add repository key to the user' in the Administration Settings. If you're using Bitbucket Cloud , since automatically adding the user keys is not supported this setting must be disabled. How does this work? When you add a repository to Codacy, it generates a new SSH key that is added to your repository using a GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab integration.

You can also fork the code of one of our tools, and modify it; here are some examples: codacy-phpmd , codacy-jshint , codacy-pmdJava . This tutorial covers only the template code to write the engine; if you didn't check the full tutorial, please refer to the Tool Developer Guide . Scala Engine Template \u00b6 We use Scala to integrate our tools at Codacy. In this template, you only need to do a couple of things to integrate your tool: Configure the build.sbt so it generates the docker to run your tool Extend the codacy.dockerApi.Tool trait Configuring build.sbt \u00b6 Our Scala template is built using sbt, which already has a great plugin to generate dockers, sbt-native-packager . To configure a docker, you should edit the build.sbt in the root directory of our template. One thing you probably want to change is the installAll value, which contains the commands to install the tools and all necessary dependencies. Implementing Tool trait \u00b6 When extending the Tool trait, you have to implement the apply method. When a client runs your tool, the apply method of our template is invoked. Here you have everything you need to invoke the tool. After you have your results from the tool, put them in our Result format, and then just return them. Scala package codacy.mytool import scala.sys.process._ import codacy.dockerApi._ object MyTool extends Tool { override def apply ( path : Path , conf : Option [ Seq [ PatternDef ]], files : Option [ Set [ Path ]])( implicit spec : Spec ) : Try [ Iterable [ Result ]] = { //TODO: Your code goes here } } path: The root path where the files to test are located (usually \"/src\") conf: Patterns to run (optional) files: Files to test (optional), their path is relative to the path received spec: Tool configuration based on your patterns.json The behavior of your application method should vary depending on the optional parameters. If you receive no files , you should invoke the tool for all files from path (path is the root directory, files are searched recursively for all folders in path ). If you receive no conf , you should test with the default patterns. When receiving conf or files , you should only run your tool for the subset of patterns in conf and files in files . You must put each result in our Result type. The used types like PatternDef and Result are defined as case classes. These and the other types are defined in dockerApi/package.scala . dockerApi/package.scala case class PatternDef ( patternId : PatternId , parameters : Option [ Set [ ParameterDef ]]) case class Result ( filename : SourcePath , message : ResultMessage , patternId : PatternId , line : ResultLine ) //... Code details of our template \u00b6 The entry point of our template for you is the Engine object. In the codacy.Engine , you can see the object Engine extends a DockerEngine that receives a Tool . Engine.scala object Engine extends DockerEngine ( MyTool ) Your tool must extend Tool , (as shown before, MyTemplate already extends it), and override the apply method. When you want to execute a command, we recommend you generate the sequence you want to run and use the process API provided by scala.sys.process._ to run it and pick up the result. Scala import scala.sys.process._ //... //The sequence of strings to run val cmd = Seq ( \"pmd\" , \"-d\" , \"/src/\" , \"-f\" , \"xml\" ) //run the command > pmd -d /src/ -f xml val cmdResponse = cmd .! //... As a final note, you may write the code to run the tool in any way you want. Simply return the results from the external tool at the end of the apply method, and our code will take care of the rest.

To know more about dockers, and how to write a docker file please refer to https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/ We use external tools at Codacy; in this tutorial, we explain how you can integrate the tool of your choice with our platform. You can check the code of an already implemented tool and, if you wish, fork it to start yours. You are free to modify it and use it for your integration. We also have a tutorial to integrate your tool using our Scala templates . Requirements \u00b6 Docker definition with the tool you want to integrate Define the documentation for the patterns provided by the tool Assumptions and Behaviour \u00b6 To run the tool we provide the configuration file, /src/.codacy.json , with the files you should analyse and also the patterns you should check. The files to analyse are located in /src , meaning that when provided in the configuration, the paths are relative to /src . .codacy.json files: Files to be analysed (their path is relative to /src) tools: Array of tools * name: Unique identifier of the tool patterns: Array of patterns that must be checked patternId: Unique identifier of the pattern parameters: Parameters of the pattern name: Unique identifier of the parameter value: Value to be used as parameter value .codacy.json { \"files\" : [ \"foo/bar/baz.js\" , \"foo2/bar/baz.php\" ], \"tools\" :[ { \"name\" : \"jshint\" , \"patterns\" :[ { \"patternId\" : \"latedef\" , \"parameters\" :[ { \"name\" : \"latedef\" , \"value\" : \"vars\" } ] } ] } ] } If /src/.codacy.json does not exist or any of its contents (files or patterns) is not available, you should invoke the tool for all files from /src (files should be searched recursively for all folders in /src ) and check them with the default patterns. When receiving /src/.codacy.json , you should only run your tool for the subset of files in files , and for the patterns present on patterns for your tool name . Setup \u00b6 1. Write the docker file that will run the tool. It must have a binary entry point without any parameters. 2. Write a patterns.json with the configuration of your tool. This file must be located on /docs/patterns.json . name: Unique identifier of the tool (lower-case letters without spaces) patterns: The patterns that the tool provides patternId: Unique identifier of the pattern (lower-case letters without spaces) level: Severity level of the issue * category: Category of the issue * parameters: Parameters received by the pattern name: Unique identifier of the parameter (lower-case letters without spaces) default: Default value of the parameter patterns.json { \"name\" : \"jshint\" , \"patterns\" :[ { \"patternId\" : \"latedef\" , \"level\" : \"Error\" , \"category\" : \"UnusedCode\" , \"parameters\" :[ { \"name\" : \"latedef\" , \"default\" : \"vars\" } ] } ] } Levels and Categories \u00b6 For level types we have: Error , Warning , Info For category types we have: ErrorProne , CodeStyle , UnusedCode , Security , Compatibility , Performance , Documentation 3. Write the code to run the tool. You are free to write this code in the language you want. Here you have to invoke the tool according to the configuration. After you have your results from the tool, you should print them to the standard output in our Result format, one result per line. The filename should not include the prefix \"/src/\" Example absolute path: /src/folder/file.js filename path: folder/file.js { \"filename\" : \"codacy/core/test.js\" , \"message\" : \"found this in your code\" , \"patternId\" : \"latedef\" , \"line\" : 2 } If you are not able to run the analysis for any of the files requested you should return an error for each one of them to the standard output in our Error format. Error { \"filename\" : \"codacy/core/test.js\" , \"message\" : \"could not parse the file\" , } Documentation \u00b6 At Codacy we strive to provide the best value to our users and, to accomplish that, we document our patterns so that the user can better understand the problem and fix it. At this point, your tool has everything it needs to run, but there is one other really important thing that you should do before submitting your docker: the documentation for your tool. Your files for this section should be placed in /docs/description/ . In order to provide more details you can create: A single /docs/description/description.json [Optional] A /docs/description/<PATTERN-ID>.md for each pattern In the description.json you define the title for the pattern, brief description, time to fix (in minutes), and also a description of the parameters in the following format: description.json [ { \"patternId\" : \"latedef\" , \"title\" : \"This is a title\" , \"description\" : \"This is a description\" , \"timeToFix\" : 5 , \"parameters\" :[ { \"name\" : \"latedef\" , \"description\" : \"this is a param description\" } ] } ] [Optional] To give a more detailed explanation about the issue, you should define the <PATTERN-ID>.md UnusedModifier.md Fields in interfaces are automatically public static final, and methods are public abstract. Classes or interfaces nested in an interface are automatically public and static (all nested interfaces are automatically static). For historical reasons, modifiers which are implied by the context are accepted by the compiler, but are superfluous. Ex: public interface Foo { public abstract void bar(); // both abstract and public are ignored by the compiler public static final int X = 0; // public, static, and final all ignored public static class Bar {} // public, static ignored public static interface Baz {} // ditto void foo(); //this is correct } public class Bar { public static interface Baz {} // static ignored } [Source](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/pmd-5.3.2/pmd-java/rules/java/unusedcode.html#UnusedModifier) You should explain the *what* and *why* of the issue. Adding an example is always a nice way to help other people understand the problem. For a more thorough explanation you can also add a link at the end referring a more complete source. ``` ## Tests After all the docker is prepared you can now test your work. To do it you should write test files and place them in **/docs/tests**, for example for PHP, **/docs/tests/UnusedModifier.php**. Each test is composed by two parts. - Identification of the patterns on the file - Identification of the errors on the file The pattern identification is placed in the beginning of the file in the following format: - &lt;LANGUAGE\\_COMMENT&gt;\\#Patterns: &lt;PATTERN\\_ID&gt;,&lt;PATTERN\\_ID&gt;,... The error identification is placed in the line before the error should happen: - &lt;LANGUAGE\\_COMMENT&gt;\\#&lt;ERROR\\_LEVEL&gt;: &lt;PATTERN\\_ID&gt; Instead of commenting in the line before the error, you can alternatively specify the line of the warning with this syntax: - &lt;LANGUAGE\\_COMMENT&gt;\\#Issue: {\"severity\": \"&lt;ERROR\\_LEVEL&gt;\", \"line\": &lt;LINE\\_NUMBER\\_WITH\\_ISSUE&gt;, \"patternId\": \"PATTERN\\_ID\"} UnusedModifier.php ```php //#Patterns: UnusedModifier public interface Foo { //#Warn: UnusedModifier public abstract void bar(); // both abstract and public are ignored by the compiler //#Warn: UnusedModifier public static final int X = 0; // public, static, and final all ignored //#Warn: UnusedModifier public static class Bar {} // public, static ignored //#Warn: UnusedModifier public static interface Baz {} // ditto void foo(); } public class Bar { //#Warn: UnusedModifier public static interface Baz {} // static ignored } To run this use our test repository available here .

Issue Categories \u00b6 Security: security issues, potential vulnerabilities, unsafe dependencies. Error Prone: bad practices/patterns that cause code to fail/prone to bugs. Code Style: related to the style of the code, line length, tabs vs spaces. Compatibility: identifies code that has problems with older systems or cross platform support. Unused Code: unnecessary code not being used. Performance: inefficiently written code. 2. Issue Level \u00b6 Info: The least critical issue type will appear as blue; for example code style issues are shown this way. Warning: This issue type will appear as yellow. You should be careful with these ones, they are based on code standards and conventions. Error: The more dangerous types of issues will show as red. Take your time to fix these, although the code may run, these issues show the code that is very susceptible to problems. These issues are bug-prone, and/or can have serious problems regarding security and compatibility. Each pattern has a pre-defined severity level and at the moment, it\u2019s not possible to customize that information. 3.

What functionalities are available? \u00b6 1. Overall Quality Chart \u00b6 The Overall Quality Chart displays your repositories and compares them against the average grade, your defined goal, and across each specific criteria: Issues, Complex Files, Duplication, and Coverage. In the upper left is the average grade (A, in this example). The graph displays how different repositories match up to your goals and the average grade. You can see how each repository is performing by hovering over the bar. If something is not up to standards, you will see it flagged. You can also go directly to each repository by clicking on the name of the repository at the bottom of each column. Other Criteria For each specific criteria (Issues, Complex Files, Duplication, and Coverage), you can click on its tab to compare repositories. This comparison will display your repositories' current statuses against the average and against your goal for this criteria. If you have over 8 repositories, you will see your repositories grouped by Grade or by the interval of Issues (number of repo you have with Issues between 0%-20%, 20%-40%, 40%-60%, 60%-80%, 80%-100%). Hover over each group of repositories to see a summary. What if you don't have Coverage set up? The graph will notify you when you click on the Coverage tab if you don't have Coverage set up for any of your repositories. What if I don't have enough repositories for comparison? If you don't have enough enough repositories for comparison, don't worry -- we have included some Open Source repositories for comparison so you can see how you match up. 2. Hotspots \u00b6 Hotspots are items that require your attention. You can click through on each to view the pull requests or dismiss them. This will dismiss the item for everybody in your team. Read more about hotspots here . 3. Open pull requests \u00b6 Under this section you can see two tabs: Most problematic pull requests (PR) and Last updated pull requests. These represent a short list of the open pull requests on the repositories of the Team you selected. Most problematic Here you can see a short list of the most problematic open pull requests in all repositories of the team(s) selected. These pull requests are defined as those not up to your defined standards that have the most potential to negatively affect your code quality. You can click directly on each pull request to see more details. Last updated This tab displays a short list of all open pull requests sorted by the date of update with a status. Pull requests can be: \"Not up to standards\", \"Up to standards\", \"Analysis failed\" (in case something went wrong during the analysis) or \"Analyzing\" (an intermediate status while the pull request is under analysis). 4.

Read below for a full description of this dashboard and all the functionalities behind it! How does it look? \u00b6 On the Repository Dashboard you can find two main sections: the repository view of a specific branch (on the left side (in white) and the main branch summary view on the right side (in gray). Overall, you will find 3 main sections on the branch specific section: 1 Quality evolution Chart , 2 Issues breakdown , 3 Coverage status ; and on the main branch section: 4 Hotspots , 5 Logs and 6 Pull requests status sections. How can I access the Repository Dashboard? \u00b6 You can access the Repository Dashboard by selecting on the Organization Dashboard a specific repository, or by trying to access a repository URL for any part of our platform. On the Repository Dashboard you can select which branch you want to see details for. You can do this by selecting (or searching on the search bar) for a specific branch, next to the name of the repository: At any given moment in time, you can go back to your Organization view by clicking on \"Team\" on the left navigation sidebar. Or you can navigate to all the different menu options available on the repository view: Commits, Files, Issues, Pull Requests, Security, Code Patterns and Settings. If you click \"Dashboard\" at this level, you will always go back to the Repository Dashboard view. What are the functionalities available? \u00b6 1. Repository certification and Quality evolution \u00b6 Here you can see the grade of the repository, and you can see thequality evolution of the repository on the Quality evolution Chart . On the chart you can select to see results for the \"Last 7 days\", forthe \"Last 31 days\" or for the \"Last 8 commits\" if you don't have datafrom the last 31 days. You can see, per criterium (Issues, Complex Files, Duplicated code and Coverage), how the repository is behaving on the last x days. You can navigate on the different criterium by clicking on the tabs of the chart. You can also see, the trend for the next 31 days (assuming the past behavior), the pull request prediction (the changes caused by open pull requests if they are not changed) and the quality standard (defined on the repository Quality Settings ). In the example you see \"Issues\" with a red indicator meaning the number of Issues is above what was defined on the quality standards. Also, we can see next to each criterium a delta (can be \"=\", a drop or an increase), representing the changes observed in the period selected. In the example, there was no change of number of Issues on the last 31 days, however there was a decrease of 160% of duplicated code. You should know for Issues/Complex Files/Duplicated code (the more we have it, the worse we are), being above of the defined standards is considered bad, so the indication will be while for Coverage (the more we have it, the better we are), being above of the defined standards will be flagged with . Still with regards to coverage it only shows a value if the most recent commit received a coverage report. We do this as one commit can easily change the size or number of files on the repository and even remove some of the files that had coverage information. For the case when you don't have recent data, we will display by default an option on your graph - \"Last 8 commits\", and we display the quality evolution (and all the other metrics) for your last 8 commits analyzed on Codacy. 2. Issues breakdown \u00b6 Here you can see the total of issues on the branch selected. Additionally, you will see a breakdown of the issues found per category of issue. By clicking on the name of the category, you will be directed to the list of issues filtered by that category. You can also click on \"See all issues\" and go to the list of issues with no category selected. In case you don't have issues this component will display 0 issues (in the total and in all categories). 3. Coverage status \u00b6 On this component of the Repository Dashboard you will see the number of files without coverage, the number of files with coverage \"not up to standards\" and files with coverage \"up to standards\" based on your quality settings (defined at the repository level). If you click on \"See all files\" you will go to the list of files. In case you don't have coverage set up for this repository we will let you know on this component, and you can click on \"Set up your coverage here\" (in case you have \"write\" permission on the Repository) and go to the repository settings to configure set up coverage. 4. Hotspots \u00b6 You have a section of relevant items that require attention on the Repository. On this section you can see a set of attention points, you can click on them or dismiss them, in case you don't feel they are relevant. We have created a full article on this, so that you can learn more about it. 5. Logs \u00b6 You have a section of relevant activities that happened on the repository you selected.

Unexpected behaviour: Assigning values to private APIs might lead to unexpected behaviour. Mass assignment: Mass assignment is a feature of Rails which allows an application to create a record from the values of a hash. Insecure storage: Storing sensitive data using this APIs is not safe. Insecure modules/libraries: Consider possible security implications associated with some modules. Visibility: Fields should not have public accessibility. CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. Android: Android specific issues. Malicious code: Exposed internal APIs can be accessed or change changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. Cryptography: Cryptography is a security technique widely used and there are several cryptographic functions, but not all of them are secure. Command injection: Command injection is an attack in which the goal is the execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system. Firefox OS: Sensitive APIs of Firefox OS. Auth: Authentication is present in almost all web applications nowadays. DoS: The Denial of Service (DoS) attack is focused on making a resource (site, application, server) unavailable for the purpose it was designed. SQL injection: A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or 'injection' of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application.
