## Previewing docs locally

[Build and preview](https://www.mkdocs.org/#getting-started) the generated HTML on your machine to validate your changes:

1.  Clone the codacy/docs repository, including the submodules, and change into the local copy directory:

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:codacy/docs.git
    cd docs
    ```

2.  Check that you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed and install them if you don't:

    ```bash
    python3 --version
    pip3 --version
    ```

3.  Install the requirements for building the static HTML pages using MkDocs:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Build the static HTML pages and launch a local web server that allows you to easily see the generated pages as soon as you make any changes to the Markdown files:

    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

A [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/codacy/docs/blob/master/.github/workflows/mkdocs.yml) automatically deploys the generated HTML to GitHub Pages on every push to `master` or to the release branches `release/v.*`.

## What is Codacy

[Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) is an automated code review tool that monitors your technical debt, helps you improve your code quality, teaches best practices to your developers, and helps you save time in code reviews.

### Among Codacy's features

-   Identify new static analysis issues
-   Commit and pull request analysis with GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab
-   Auto-comments on commits and pull requests
-   Integrations with Slack, Jira

Codacy also helps keep track of code coverage, code duplication, and code complexity.
